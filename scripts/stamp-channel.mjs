// Writes electron/channel.json, which is how the packaged desktop app knows
// whether it is the stable build or the beta one. Same pattern as the build id
// the release workflow stamps into electron/build-id.json: a generated file the
// app reads at startup, never committed.
//
// This exists instead of electron-builder's `extraMetadata` because that option
// rewrites the project's own package.json while it packages — and a build that is
// interrupted at the wrong moment leaves the repo's package.json stripped of its
// scripts. Not a risk worth running to pass one string.
//
//   node scripts/stamp-channel.mjs beta     -> the beta build
//   node scripts/stamp-channel.mjs stable   -> removes the stamp (the default)
