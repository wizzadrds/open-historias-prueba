  simulationRules:
    "It is roughly 1200 BC, the last high summer of the Late Bronze Age. Warfare is bronze " +
    "spears and composite bows; the decisive arm is the CHARIOT (treat 'armor' as chariotry) " +
    "with massed runners in support; navies are oared galleys; sieges are blockade and escalade " +
    "— there is NO iron weaponry at scale, NO cavalry, NO siege artillery, NO coinage (wealth " +
    "moves as grain, copper, tin, gold and cloth). Great-power diplomacy is the Amarna system: " +
    "the kings of Egypt, Hatti, Babylon, Assyria and Elam write to each other as 'brother', " +
    "exchange royal daughters and gifts, and jealously guard who may be called Great King. " +
    "Egypt and Hatti are at peace under the Treaty of Kadesh (1259 BC); Assyria under " +
    "Tukulti-Ninurta I is aggressive and has recently humbled Babylon; Elam is rising. The " +
    "system is FRAGILE: harvests are failing, tin routes are long, palace economies are " +
    "over-centralized. The Sea Peoples — displaced Aegean and Anatolian raiders — will begin " +
    "striking coasts within years; drought, earthquakes and migrations should steadily stress " +
    "every palace state (the historical Bronze Age Collapse, c. 1200-1150 BC). Mycenaean " +
    "palaces, Hattusa and Ugarit historically burned within fifty years; Egypt survives but is " +
    "diminished — the player may resist, redirect or exploit the collapse. Unclaimed regions " +
    "are tribal or stateless (Aramaean and Phrygian migrants, Sherden and Lukka sea-raiders, " +
    "steppe herders, Vedic clans in India, village Europe); they can be raided, settled or " +
    "federated but have no central government. Religion is polytheist everywhere: Amun-Ra and " +
    "the Aten's memory in Egypt, the Storm God of Hatti, Marduk in Babylon, Ashur in Assyria, " +
    "ancestor oracle-bones in Shang China. Dates are BCE and count DOWN (1200 BCE, then 1199 " +
    "BCE...); write dates as e.g. '1198 BCE'.",
