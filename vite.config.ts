// The big map binaries live in public/ so the dev server and the Express server can
// serve them off disk, but NEITHER build serves them from the bundle: the desktop
// streams them via /api/runtime/pmtiles/:assetKey, and the website fetches them from
// the content nodes, hash-verified against the signed manifest.
//
// Vite copies publicDir wholesale and offers no partial exclude, so it duplicated
// ~160MB into dist/ and — worse — made `npm run build:site` emit a site Cloudflare
// Pages REJECTS outright: its limit is 25 MiB per file and regions.pmtiles is ~101.
//
// The trap is that it only fires on a machine that has actually played. The files
// are gitignored and arrive from the map-data Release at first launch, so CI and a
// fresh clone build fine and the deploy failure looks random. Dropping them after
// the copy is the fix; "remember to delete them before deploying" is not.
// Never wanted in EITHER build: nothing loads a pmtiles archive from the bundle.
// The desktop streams them off disk via /api/runtime/pmtiles/:assetKey and the
// website fetches them from the content nodes, hash-verified. Copying them in only
// broke the Pages deploy at its 25 MiB-per-file limit.

// SPA fallback, answer with index.html, and the editor open with zero regions.
//
// The web build resolves them from VITE_OH_PMTILES_URL instead (see
