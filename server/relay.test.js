// Integration tests for the AI relay — the path a self-hosted model's answers
// take when the browser cannot call the endpoint directly (no CORS).
//
// These boot the REAL server against a fake AI endpoint, because the bug they
// exist to prevent is not visible in any single function: the relay used to
// speak through Node's fetch(), whose undici default gave up 300 seconds after
// a request was sent if the endpoint had not answered yet. A big save's prompt
// evaluated by a local model takes longer than that, so the relay killed turns
// the player had not limited — the game then served canned events, exactly as
// though "Limit AI generation" were on, which is how it was reported.
//
// The 300-second number itself is too slow to assert in a test suite. What is
// asserted here is the shape that made it possible: that the relay hands bytes
// back as they arrive rather than waiting for the whole answer, that a slow
// first byte is not fatal, and that the only deadline left is the one this
// project chose (OH_RELAY_TIMEOUT_MS) — which now ANSWERS instead of leaving
// the game waiting on a socket forever.
