// Run: node --test server/desktopPortProbe.test.js
//
// Reported 2026-09-04: the beta would not launch on a laptop running Docker
// Desktop. app.log had `listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:3000` followed by
// `ERR_FAILED loading 'http://localhost:3000'` — the server never came up, so the
// window had nothing to load and the app looked like it simply did not start.
//
// The probe had bound the WILDCARD to decide whether a port was free, while
// server.js binds loopback by default. On Windows a wildcard bind succeeds beside
// a listener on a specific interface, so a port Docker was holding on 127.0.0.1
// looked free, and the bind that mattered then failed.
//
// electron/main.cjs requires electron and cannot be imported by `node --test`, so
// the probe is sliced out of it and evaluated with `net` in scope. That keeps the
// test honest — it exercises the shipped text, not a copy of it — at the price of
// failing loudly if those functions are renamed, which is the right trade.
