// The Board and Storylines working together (world director side).
//
// The Board reads every Canonical event, so the cleanup can keep routine Board
// progress off the timeline without the Board losing it; and a major event whose
// only consequence is a Board entry passes the consequence check provisionally,
// to be proven by the board pass after the segments. These tests pin the
// director's half of that contract.
