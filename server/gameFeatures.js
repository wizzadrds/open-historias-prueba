// Shared by the server store, the web store and the client, so it lives under

//
// A scenario carries a COMPLETE configuration — every feature, every setting —
// which is the default for every game made from it. A game carries only the
// fields it overrides, so a scenario edited later still reaches every game that
// never overrode that field. Add a feature here and it appears in both editors
// and in resolveFeatures with its defaults; gate the code it controls with
// isFeatureEnabled (client: isActiveFeatureEnabled in src/runtime/gameFeatures.js).
