// Run: node --test server/betaPackaging.test.js
//
// The beta desktop build is described in four places that have to agree and that
// nothing at runtime checks:
//
//   electron-builder.beta.yml      what is installed, and where it looks for updates
//   electron/main.cjs              what the running app thinks it is, and where the
//                                  update BANNER polls
//   .github/workflows/desktop-beta.yml  where the build is actually published
//   package.json                   the stable build, which none of this may touch
//
// Every way they can disagree fails silently on a player's machine: a tester is
// told an update exists by one feed while the installer feed points somewhere with
// nothing in it, or the banner offers a download URL for a filename electron-builder
// never produced, or the beta quietly ships without a file the stable build packages.
// So the disagreements are caught here instead.
