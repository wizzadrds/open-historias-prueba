// Run the tests: node --test src/runtime/gmChanges.test.js
//
// Two things the simulator was never told.
//
// 1. CHANGES. The cheats panel changes the world between turns: a country
//    annexed, a border redrawn region by region, a polity's stability set by
//    hand, a city placed, an event written into the record, the history
//    document rewritten, a turn rolled back. The GM console's AI-assisted
//    transactions are logged in world.gmAudit; the rest were logged nowhere. The
//    next skip saw the new state with no word of how it came about — a border
//    that moved with no event, a government that changed with no cause — and a
//    model shown an unexplained change tends to explain it, or to undo it.
//
//    So every such change is one line in world.gmChanges, tagged with the
//    round it happened in. The next time skip starts from that round, and it
//    opens with those lines (beside the application receipt): once, because the
//    round moves on when the skip lands; again after a rollback, because the
//    skip that heard them no longer happened.
//
// 2. REMINDERS. A standing note from the Game Master to every AI in the game —
//    the skip, the checks after it, the advisor, the leaders: "the Kerch bridge
//    is down", "the harvest has failed in the south". Every AI sees every
//    reminder — a leader included — so a reminder is for a fact, never a secret
//    (reports.js is where an audience is kept). Unlike the scenario's priority rules
//    (an author's rules for the whole game, worldDirection.js) a reminder is a
//    fact the GM declares mid-game, dated, one of a short list, removed when it
//    stops being true. Every prompt carries the whole list, so an edited one is
//    simply what the next prompt says — there is no delivered-once bookkeeping to
//    go stale. Withdrawing one IS a change of its own, so the next skip is told the
//    fact no longer holds.
//
// Import-free: gameState.js normalizes both on every read and write, the cheats
// panel records, gameplay.js and main.jsx render, and all of it is testable
// under bare node.
