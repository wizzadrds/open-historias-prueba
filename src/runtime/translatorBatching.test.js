// How many strings ride in one translation request decides how much of a free
// key's daily allowance a non-English player spends just opening the game
// (AI/requestBudget.js). It used to be 60 strings × 3 concurrent requests; a
// first pass over a new language was dozens of requests nobody pressed a button
// for. These pin the sizing, and the one rule that keeps a big batch safe: a
// reply that must not be truncated is bounded by CHARACTERS as well as count.
