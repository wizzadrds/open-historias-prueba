// Merges the AI's polity overrides onto the country list read from the tiles.
//
// Why this exists as its own pure module: it got this wrong in a way that only
// showed up in the UI. world.polityOverrides is keyed by country NAME — the same
// namespace as colors and internationalReputation — and its entries do not carry
// a `code` (checked across real saves: 85 overrides in one campaign, 84 of them
// name-keyed, none with a code). The merge treated that key as a code and did
//
//   merged.set(polity.code || key, { code: polity.code || key, name })
//
// so "Germany" was added ALONGSIDE the tile entry { code: "DEU", name: "Germany" }
// instead of updating it. The list then carried the same name twice, and in a long
// campaign dozens of times over.
//
// That is not cosmetic. The chat and spy pickers key their tiles AND their
// selection by name (`key={c.name}`, `isSelectedName(c.name)`), so duplicate
// names collide React keys: the same country renders repeatedly, a search misses
// the country it matched, and clicking one tile marks a different one selected
// without highlighting anything.
