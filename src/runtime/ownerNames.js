// A polity is identified EVERYWHERE by its full country name — "Spain", never "ESP".
// Ownership, colours, flags, tags and the AI's own vocabulary are all keyed that way
// (see server/ownerMigration.js, which migrated stored worlds to it). GADM's three
// letter codes remain only as provenance inside the .pmtiles binaries and on a
// region's `gid0`/`countryCode`; they are not an identity anyone keys off.
//
// The one place a code can still appear is INBOUND: a legacy save written before the
// migration, or a model that answers "ESP" out of habit. Both funnel through here and
// come out as the name, so a code can never enter the world state and mint a phantom
// country sitting alongside the real one ("ESP" painted next to "Spain").

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Display names vs identity
//
// A polity is renamed by writing polityOverrides[token].name — the KEY never
// moves, so "Germany" stays the identity while "Third Reich" becomes the label.
// That only holds if every inbound owner is folded back to the token: a model
// that writes a transfer to "Third Reich" (the name it just read in the story)
// would otherwise mint a second owner beside the first, and the world splits in
// two — half the regions keyed "Germany" with the country's colour, tags,
// reputation and stat sheet, half keyed "Third Reich" with none of them and a
// procedural fallback colour on the map.
//
// Hence one shared alias map, built from the polity registry and applied
// wherever an owner enters the world state (gameState.normalizeWorldState and
// applyEventImpactsToWorld) or is compared against one (the AI's region-transfer
// resolver).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Case-, diacritic- and punctuation-insensitive identity for an owner token, so
// "Côte d'Ivoire", "cote divoire" and "COTE D'IVOIRE" are one polity. Separators
// are dropped rather than folded to a space: the model spells a name back the way
// it remembers it, and an apostrophe it left out must not make a new country.
