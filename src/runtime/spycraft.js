// Espionage runs in both directions. The player plants spies in other polities
// and reads their private diplomacy; other polities plant spies in the player
// and read theirs. Every spy can be discovered by the target's service, and a
// discovered spy can be turned into a double agent that feeds its owner what
// the target wants believed. All of it is decided by two numbers — the owner's
// intelligence service and the target's — so the stat is the whole game here.
//
// Pure and dependency-free so all of it is unit-tested without a browser: no
// store reads, no React, no crypto (spySeal.js does that). Randomness is a
// seeded draw, so the same world on the same round always resolves the same way
// and a test can pin every branch.
