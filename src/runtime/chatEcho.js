// Why this exists: the idle-diplomacy note is generated from a one-line-per-chat
// SUMMARY, whose last entry for a thread is often the player's own message. Asked
// for an opening note, a model handed "China: France: We think you suck!" has
// repeated the player's line straight back as China's — the note is then appended
// to that very thread, so the player watches a country parrot them. The prompt
// already says never to repeat a note already visible; that is advice, and this is
// the check.
//
// Pure and dependency-free on purpose, like eventDedup.js: it is unit-tested
// directly, without the browser-only asset layer gameplay.js pulls in.

// Lowercased, punctuation and whitespace flattened, so "We think you suck!" and
// "we think you suck" collide while genuinely different sentences do not.

// True when `text` says the same thing as something already in the thread.
//
// Exact match after normalization, plus containment in EITHER direction, which is
// what catches the real failure: a model that echoes the player's line verbatim
// and then tacks on a clause. Anything shorter than a few characters is ignored —
// "ok" or "no" legitimately recur in a conversation and must not block a note.
