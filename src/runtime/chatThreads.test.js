// Run: node --test src/runtime/chatThreads.test.js

// Runs without node_modules: chatThreads.js imports nothing.
//
// The invariant: the projection of a log is exactly the shape every existing
// reader of a chat expects (countries, messages, title), so event-sourcing the
// threads changes nothing for them — while the log answers what the old shape
// could not: who was in the room when something was said, who renamed it, and
// how the vote went.
