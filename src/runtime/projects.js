// Everything the Projects & Operations board can work out for ITSELF, with no AI
// turn involved.
//
// This split is the point of the feature. The model owns what only it can know —
// what a programme is, how far along it is, what comes next — and this file owns
// everything that follows from the calendar. A project whose target date slips
// past is flagged the moment the clock moves, whether or not the AI ever
// mentions it again. That is what stops the board reading like a snapshot of
// whenever the model last thought about it.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE, the same trick unitMotion.js / eventFocus.js /
// forcePosture.js use: gameState.js reaches assets.js, which imports maplibre-gl,
// so anything importing it cannot be tested without a full install. Keeping this
// file dependency-free means `node --test src/runtime/projects.test.js` runs in a
// bare checkout. Worth preserving.

// A milestone landing inside this window is "due soon". Sized against the jump
// buttons the player actually uses: the 1-month jump is the common one, so a
// month of look-ahead means the board warns you before the jump that would blow
// through the milestone, not after it.

// board and an event. Most of those passes returned nothing: no event touched an
// entry and nothing was due. Everything that makes a pass worth making is visible
// from here, without asking anyone:
//
//   - an event names, or plainly describes, an open entry;
//   - an event reads like the START of a long effort (the pass is the only thing
//     that opens entries);
//   - the calendar has caught up with an entry — overdue, a slipped milestone, or
//     nothing reported for STALE_ROUNDS — and nobody has looked at it for
//     BOARD_PASS_QUIET_ROUNDS;
//   - one of the player's own HIGH PRIORITY entries has gone that long unassessed.
//
// The quiet-rounds rule is what keeps one permanently overdue programme from
// buying a request every turn: it is looked at, and then left for a round. It is
// counted twice over — from the entry's own last update, and from the last pass
// that ran at all (`reviewedRound`, world.boardReviewedRound) — because a pass
// may look at an overdue entry and rightly leave it alone, and an entry nobody
// touched must not ask again the very next turn.
// HIGH PRIORITY used to mean "assessed every jump"; while requests are being
// saved it means "at least every second one", and sooner whenever an event
// concerns it.
//
