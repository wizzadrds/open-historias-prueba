// A government does not keep its papers in a separate app. A letter from
// another head of state arrives through the ambassador; a rival's secret
// protocol arrives, if it arrives at all, through an agent; a published treaty
// is in the news. world.reports (runtime/reports.js) is the file — what the
// simulation and the leaders know — and this module decides, for each document
// that changed hands in a turn, how the PLAYER comes to read it:
//
//   diplomacy     the player holds it with other governments: it is filed in
//                 the thread with them, spoken by its sender (a letter from the
//                 Tsar lands in the chat with Russia);
//   intelligence  the player does not hold it, but has an agent in a
//                 government that does: the agent brings a copy, filed in the
//                 Spies tab among that agent's intercepts — sealed, and decoded
//                 only as far as the player's service can read the target's;
//   event         it was published, or the player's own government is its only
//                 holder (a cable to the ministry, an assessment from its own
//                 service): it is shown on the event that produced it.
//
// Anything else — a secret between two other powers with no agent of the
// player's among them — stays in the file, where the simulation and its holders
// know it and the player does not.
//
// Import-free: gameplay.js plans and files, time.jsx shows the event's own,
// and all of it is tested under bare node.
