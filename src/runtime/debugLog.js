/*! Open Historia — in-game diagnostics log © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// The log a player can paste into a bug report.
//
// Before this, the only diagnostics the game could hand out were per-incident:
// the advisor's "Copy for a bug report" and the timeline's "Copy debugging
// message" (time.jsx), both of which described ONE failed AI turn and nothing
// around it. That is the wrong shape for most reports, which are of the form
// "I loaded this save, queued these actions, jumped twice and the border went
// wrong" — a SEQUENCE. The packaged desktop app binds no developer tools (no
// F12, no menu entry), so the console those steps were already being written to
// was unreachable, and asking a player to reproduce a bug with DevTools open is
// asking most players for nothing.
//
// So: a rolling buffer of what happened, kept in memory, mirrored to
// localStorage so it survives the reload after a crash, and emitted as one
// plain-text report behind a Copy button and a Download button in
// Settings → Diagnostics.
//
// Those per-incident buttons are now "Save logging file" buttons
// (runtime/saveDebugLog.js). Pasting only the incident is what players did, and
// it left out everything around it, so the buttons now save THIS log with the
// incident's own details attached at the top — see `incident` on
// buildDebugLogReport.
//
// ONE LOG, ONE FILE. On desktop, the app's Electron process and its local server
// see things the page never can — a launch that failed before the page existed,
// an update that did not take, a server error — and they cannot reach this
// buffer, so they write the Desktop log (server/logStore.js). Every way out of
// here (buildLoggingFile) fetches those entries and merges them in by time, so
// the player sends one Logging file of at most 1 MB. Each entry is stored once,
// by whoever saw it: the page never writes to the Desktop log.
//
// WHAT GOES IN. Two sources:
//   1. Explicit logDebugEvent() calls at the milestones a report needs — game
//      loaded/saved, turn started/finished/fell back, action queued, rollback,
//      provider changed, settings toggled.
//   2. Every console.warn / console.error the game already writes, plus
//      uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections, captured by
//      installDebugLogCapture(). The codebase logs its failures diligently
//      ("[actions] could not revert the unit order", "Failed to save actions")
//      and that is exactly the material a report needs, so it is collected
//      rather than duplicated by hand at every call site.
//
// WHAT NEVER GOES IN. API keys. Nothing here reads a key deliberately, but a
// key can arrive by accident inside a provider error, a URL or a stringified
// request, so redactSecrets() below is a second line of defence run over every
// entry as it is recorded — not at export time, so a key is never even held in
// the buffer. See that function for what it catches.
//
// Campaign text in the NORMAL log is kept short on purpose: titles, counts and
// ids, not event prose or chat bodies. A log a player is willing to paste in
// public is worth more than a complete one they are not. Detailed mode is the
// deliberate exception — see below.
//
// TWO SWITCHES, both in Settings → Diagnostics and both persisted in
// localStorage so they survive closing the app and switching campaigns:
//
//   * Logging (default ON). Off means nothing is recorded and the stored log is
//     thrown away — and, on the machine running the server, the Desktop log
//     with it. Checked at the top of logDebugEvent so a disabled log costs the
//     game nothing beyond a boolean test.
//   * Detailed logging (default OFF). Adds the entries marked `{ verbose: true }`
//     at their call sites — every AI task and API call rather than only the
//     failures, a prompt fingerprint per AI attempt, world-state changes turn by
//     turn, panel navigation, console.log chatter — and keeps far more of each
//     one (longer details, deeper stacks). Never a whole prompt: the fingerprint
//     is what lets a prompt rebuilt from the save be checked against it.
//     It is off by default because it is heavier and quotes more of the
//     campaign, and on when a maintainer asks for it.
//
//     It also carries the full text of every conversation with the model: what
//     the player asked the advisor and what it answered, every diplomatic
//     message in both directions, and the notes a turn or the idle drip put in
//     the player's inbox. That is a deliberate choice, because the bugs people
//     actually report about the advisor and diplomacy — "it forgot what I told
//     it", "it replied as the wrong country", "it drafted a letter and sent
//     something else", "the block it sent never reached the board" — are all
//     about the CONTENT of an exchange, and a log recording only that an
//     exchange happened cannot settle any of them. Everything on this path is
//     campaign fiction the player wrote or the model wrote back; none of it is a
//     credential (redactSecrets still runs over it), but it is much more of
//     their campaign than the normal log quotes, and the Diagnostics panel says
//     so beside the switch.
//
// The buffer is bounded by SIZE, not only by entry count, and drops its oldest
// entries to stay there — see trimToBudget.

import { escapeForRegExp, redactLogText } from "../../server/logRedaction.js";

// Two ceilings, and the size one is the one that really governs. Both modes
// share them: they differ in WHAT they record, not in how much of it they keep.
//
// MAX_ENTRIES stops a quiet session growing without bound; MAX_LOG_CHARS is what
// keeps the log inside the storage it has to live in, and matches the Logging
// file's own 1 MB, so the log never holds more than a report can carry. A normal
// log used to get 192 KB and 400 entries, which on a busy campaign reached back
// barely an hour; a detailed one carries whole conversations, and against that

// setting. Characters, not bytes — Chromium stores them as UTF-16, so 1 MB here
// is ~2 MB of the quota, still well inside it. The cost that grows with it is
// the background save, which rewrites the whole buffer: measured in Chromium at
// ~5 ms for a full 1 MB log (6 ms at worst), inside one 60 fps frame. If that

// them. 20k is chosen to clear a long advisor answer (a few thousand characters,
// plus whatever fenced blocks it carries) whole.
const MAX_DETAIL_CHARS_VERBOSE = 20_000;

// for. So an entry identical to a recent one bumps that entry's counter
// instead of appending.
//
// Scanned over a WINDOW of recent entries rather than only the previous one,
