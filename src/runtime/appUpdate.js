//
// Why the check goes through the app's OWN server (/api/app-update) rather than
// fetching GitHub from the client: the game runs at the embedded server's origin
// (127.0.0.1:3000), NOT the Capacitor origin, so it has no native-HTTP bridge and a
// direct fetch to a GitHub release asset is subject to WebView CORS. The server
// fetches server-side (no CORS) and caches the result for the same window below, so
// thousands of clients polling every few minutes still hit GitHub only ~20x/hour per
// device — against a CDN release asset, never the 60/hour REST API. That keeps it
// safe even behind shared carrier IPs.

// Effective poll cadence (the server caches for the same window, so this is also the
// real GitHub lookup rate per device).

// transient and must keep it alive.
//
// Listing what is FINISHED rather than what is running, deliberately. The updater
// passes through "available" between finding an update and its first
// download-progress event, and a poll that only recognized "checking" and
// "downloading" tore itself down there and never restarted — leaving the banner
// frozen mid-update while the download ran to completion behind it. Written this way
// round, an unrecognized state keeps polling instead of silently stopping, so
// another lifecycle state can be added without reintroducing that freeze.
