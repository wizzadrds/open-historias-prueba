// One "Save logging file" for every place a failure is shown — the timeline's
// fallback warning, the advisor's error bubble, its board-update warning — and
// the Save button in Settings → Diagnostics.
//
// Those failure buttons used to copy a report of the ONE failure to the
// clipboard, and that paste is what arrived in Discord: the failure without the
// log around it, so every report needed a second round-trip to ask for the file.
// Saving the file itself, with the failure attached at the top (see `incident`
// on buildDebugLogReport), makes the first thing a player sends the whole thing.
//
// Two exceptions:
//   * Logging turned off. There is no log to send, so the buttons go back to
//     copying the failure on its own (copyIncidentReport) under their old
//     labels, and switch over live if logging is turned back on.
//   * A save that fails. The file goes out through runtime/saveFile.js — a
//     download in a browser, Downloads/Open Historia in the Android app — and if that
//     throws, the same report goes to the clipboard instead, and the button says
//     so.
