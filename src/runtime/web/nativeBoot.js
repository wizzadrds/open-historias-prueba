/*! Open Historia — Android boot screen © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// The Android app is this same web bundle packaged with Capacitor, and it used to
// inherit the WEBSITE's entry screen: a marketing card — badge, tagline, "a
// community-hosted alternative to Pax Historia" — with an "Enter Open Historia"
// button that had to be pressed before the game appeared. On a phone that reads as
// a website in a shell, and it made the player confirm something they had already
// confirmed by tapping the app icon.
//
// This replaces it there (and only there). A boot screen is up while the library
// is seeded — and, on a build that still streams its map from a content node,
// while the node is found — then the app goes straight into the game. The
// website keeps its home page — a browser tab genuinely is arriving from nowhere
// and has a download to offer; an installed app does not. The Android app since
// 2026-09 has the whole world inside the APK, so its screen only waits on the
// seeding and says so.
//
// Deliberately free of imports, including Vite's `import.meta.env`, so it stays
// loadable outside a bundler and its policy can be tested. The connection itself
// is handed in by index.js rather than imported: nodeConnect.js reads
// import.meta.env at module scope and cannot be loaded by `node --test`.

const BOOT_ID = "oh-native-boot";

// Long enough that a fast connection does not flash the screen and vanish, short
// enough that it never feels like a wait. Measured from first paint, not from the
// connection starting, so seeding time counts toward it.
export const MIN_VISIBLE_MS = 500;

// The boot screen must never be the reason a player cannot reach their games. A
// node probe already has its own 4s timeout, but the directory fetch in front of
// it does not, and a captive portal can hang a request indefinitely. Past this the
// screen comes down regardless; the connection keeps going and simply settles
// behind the game, which is what the heartbeat does for the rest of the session.
