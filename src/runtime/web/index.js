// evict under pressure — losing saved games outright, and turning the next
// launch into a full re-download of the world map.

// real directory. Chrome grants it on engagement or when the app is installed,
// Firefox prompts, Safari decides on its own — and an Android WebView shell is
// an installed app, which is the case that matters most here. Best-effort in
// every sense: a refusal is not an error, and nothing waits on the answer.
