// Run: node --test src/runtime/web/nativeBoot.test.js
//
// The boot screen stands between the player and their games, so the two ways it
// can go wrong are both "the app never opens": it decides it is native when it is
// not (the website would lose its home page), or it stays up because nothing ever
// settled. nativeBoot.js is deliberately import-free so both are testable here -
// nodeConnect.js reads import.meta.env at module scope and cannot be loaded by
// `node --test`, which is why index.js passes the connection in rather than the
// boot screen importing it.
