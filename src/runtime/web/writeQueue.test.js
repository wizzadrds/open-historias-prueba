// Reported: on the website the game date does not progress properly; in the
// desktop app it always does. Same game code — the difference is the store. The
// web store keeps every runtime JSON asset of a game in ONE IndexedDB record, so
// writing one asset is a read-modify-write of all of them, and the end of a turn
// fires six of those concurrently (gameplay.js, the Promise.all after a jump).
//
// The first test below is the bug itself, reproduced against a stand-in store: it
// asserts the OLD behaviour loses writes, so if the coupling is ever removed and
// this stops being possible, it fails and says so. The rest pin the fix.
