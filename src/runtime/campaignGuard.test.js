// Reported 2026-09-04: a Modern Day jump was still generating when the player
// opened a 1911 campaign. The turn finished, wrote through the runtime endpoints
// the switch had repointed, and six months of 2016 landed on the 1911 save —
// destroying it, and leaving the campaign that generated the turn at its start.
