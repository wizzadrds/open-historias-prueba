/*! Open Historia — suggestions travelling between players: tests © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// Run: node --test src/runtime/scenarioSuggestion.test.js
//
// A suggestion goes from the player who edited a community scenario to its
// author as a comment on the post with a small .zip attached. What has to hold:
//   - the author's game recognises its own posts by the key Publish wrote, and
//     a suggestion by its file or its marker line, never any other comment;
//   - comments are read only for a post whose comment count moved;
//   - the .zip carries only the changes, and reads back exactly (a cover image
//     and a basemap travel as files of their own);
//   - a details change is "open", "conflict" or "applied" against the author's
//     scenario as it is now, and accepting builds the save that applies it.
