// Three armies are ordered to Kharkiv and a base is built there: four things at
// one point, drawn as one. The player sees a single counter, clicks it, and gets
// whichever happened to be on top. Nothing was wrong with any of the four
// placements; they just were not told about each other.
//
// spaceOut takes the point a thing WANTS and the things already standing, and
// finds the nearest spot where it fits. Each thing has a footprint (a radius on
// the ground, sized so counters read as separate at the zoom a theatre is played
// at). The search walks outward on a golden-angle spiral — each step a little
// further out and turned by ~137.5 degrees, so the ring is filled evenly rather
// than in a line — and takes the first spot that touches nothing. A spot that
// would leave the thing's own region (`inside`) is pulled back along the line to
// where it started until it is inside again, so an army spaced off its neighbour
// never ends up across a border or in the sea. If nowhere is clear, the least
// crowded spot found is used: a little overlap beats a wrong country.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE, like unitMotion.js. Deterministic: the same inputs
// give the same point.
