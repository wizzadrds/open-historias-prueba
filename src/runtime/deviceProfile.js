// Open Historia — should this device trade a little speed for memory?
//
// A phone's WebView gets a fraction of the memory a desktop tab does, and a few
// of the map's costs land all at once: the regions file parsed by two readers,
// a burst of tile workers, the globe's lighting redrawn on every frame of a
// drag. On a constrained device those are staggered or throttled (Nations.jsx,
// Map/mapLibreSetup.js, GlobeEffects.jsx); everywhere else they run flat out.
//
// Constrained is any of: the Android app; a touch-only screen (nothing can
// hover and the pointer is a finger: a phone or a tablet, in any browser); a
// browser that reports 4 GB of memory or less. navigator.deviceMemory is capped
// at 8 by the spec, so it can say "small" but never "big": a phone with 12 GB
// reports what a 64 GB desktop does, which is why it is not the only signal.
//
// localStorage "oh_device_profile" = "constrained" or "full" overrides the
// guess: for trying the phone path on a desktop, or giving a strong tablet the
// fast one. Decided once per page load, so every caller agrees.

// land, and are hashed (a second copy each), just as the loading screen hands
// over to the map, which is when the tile workers and the regions parse peak
// too. That was the moment iOS Safari killed the tab ("A problem repeatedly
// occurred"). There the map reads the archives over HTTP range requests, a
// tile at a time, as it does anyway until a warm finishes; the opening screen
// needs one 40 KB tile of each. The Android app still loads them whole: its
// APK assets cannot be range-read (wholeFileSource.js), and it ships the
// trimmed z8 archives.
