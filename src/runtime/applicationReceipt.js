// What the engine actually did with the simulator's last answer, told back to
// the simulator at the start of its next one.
//
// The turn pipeline has always been careful about this WITHIN a turn: a strict
// first attempt returns the validator's complaint with the real vocabulary
// attached, and the one retry usually fixes it. But the final attempt is
// salvage — an operation that names nothing is dropped in place so a finished
// generation is never lost over a stale id — and after that the curator may
// keep an event off the timeline, the integrity screen may hide one, and a
// transfer may be turned into a claim. Every one of those is a place where what
// the model believes it did and what the world now says part ways, and until
// now nothing told it. The next turn it built on a capture that never landed.
//
// A receipt is the difference, in sentences a model can act on. It rides on the
// head of world.simulationHistory, so a rollback restores the receipt that
// belongs to the restored turn and an exported game carries its own; only the
// newest turn keeps its notes (older entries keep the counts), so the polled
// world file never grows by more than one receipt.
//
// Import-free on purpose: gameState.js normalizes it on every read and write,
// gameplay.js fills and renders it, and both are tested under bare node.
