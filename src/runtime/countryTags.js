// What a country IS, in short traits: "socialist", "authoritarian", "anti-nato".
// The map-maker sets the starting tags in the editor (tags.json on the scenario);
// the AI reads them as context for everything that country does and rewrites them
// as the world changes, which lands in world.countryTags.
//
// This module owns the two rules both halves must agree on — how a tag list is
// normalized, and which source wins — so the editor and the runtime cannot drift.
// It deliberately imports nothing: the editor, the game and the server all use it.

// one spelling instead of "anti-nato" / "anti nato" / "antiNATO" splitting the
// model's attention three ways.
