// Difficulty 2.0 doctrine:
// - difficulty changes how uncertainty, opposition, mistakes, and bargaining are resolved;
// - it NEVER rewrites canonical facts, deterministic accounting, territory semantics, or GM/editor intent;
// - higher difficulty means less benefit of the doubt and more competent causally-motivated opposition,
//   not secret anti-player knowledge or a world that conspires against the human.

Difficulty adjusts how uncertainty, opposition, player mistakes, and bargaining are resolved.

Higher difficulty means less benefit of the doubt and more competent causally-motivated opposition — never anti-player scripting, secret knowledge, or arbitrary penalties.
