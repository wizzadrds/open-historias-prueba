// exactly as the previous renderer did. A scenario may still hand a polity a
// cartographic name of its own with polityOverrides[owner].mapLabel. The
// stock-country geography (gadm0 references) is deliberately NOT used to
// shorten "Russian Federation" to "Russia": the designer wrote the long form
// on purpose, and a guessed short name is what "Kingdom of Prussia" -> "Prussia"
// looked like until the same rule turned an invented polity into a country.
