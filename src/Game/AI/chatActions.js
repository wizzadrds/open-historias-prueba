/*! Open Historia — one request speaks for every AI participant © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// A four-way chat used to cost four requests for one player message: one to
// decide who speaks next (the `nextSpeaker` task) and one for each leader who
// answered, capped at three. On a free key — a few hundred requests a day
// (requestBudget.js) — a single afternoon of diplomacy was the day's allowance.
//
// So a turn of a thread is ONE request that returns an ordered ACTION BATCH,
// acting for every AI participant at once:
//
//   send_message · add_reaction · rename_chat · add_member · remove_member
//   create_poll · add_poll_option · poll_vote
//
// Each action is validated on its own and applied on its own: a batch with one
// bad action still lands the rest, and what was refused is fed back into the
// next turn in words the model can act on — the same discipline as the
// application receipt for a time skip.
//
// The batch is then said a line at a time, a few seconds apart, and the player
// may cut in on what has not been said yet (planChatReveal, below).
//
// Two rules the reference taught, kept because they are what make a batch
// coherent rather than a list of messages:
//   - REFS, NOT IDS. A poll invented in this batch is addressed by the
//     `pollRef` the batch itself introduced, so it can be created and voted in
//     one answer. The engine mints the real id.
//   - A POLL IS BINDING. Every AI participant that would vote must vote in the
//     same batch; a poll nobody answered is a failed action, not a mood check.
//
// Actors are named by their exact display name — never an internal id, and
// never the player: a model may not speak for a human.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE: the rules on plain data. The caller hands in the
// roster and applies the resulting events (runtime/chatThreads.js).
