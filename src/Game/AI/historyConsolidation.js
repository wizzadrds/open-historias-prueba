// Consolidation keeps ONE living history document (world.historyDocument).
// The first pass writes it from the oldest events; every later pass rewrites
// it — the next period folded in, and once the document is over its word
// budget the least important older material condensed or dropped to make
// room. The event log is never touched: every event stays in the save in
// full, and a pass only moves the boundary the AI reads from
// (getUnconsolidatedEvents, promptContext.js). world.consolidatedHistory is
// the ledger of passes — each one's boundary, the chat and order ids it
// folded, and its own addition — which is also what a campaign consolidated
// before the document existed is shown until the first document pass. This
// module is what the turn, the Cheats panel's History Document tool and the
// tests all agree through.
