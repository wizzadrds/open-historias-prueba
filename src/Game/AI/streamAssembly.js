// Turning a streamed response back into the buffered envelope the extractors in
// main.jsx already understand, so a call can stream WITHOUT the rest of the code
// learning that it did.
//
// Two reasons a call streams:
//
//   1. Cancel. Local inference servers (llama.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama) only notice
//      a dead connection when they next WRITE, so a non-streaming request keeps
//      generating after Cancel — the reported "cancel doesn't actually stop my
//      local model". Streaming makes the stop physical: the next token write
//      fails and inference halts within a token or two.
//
//   2. Staying alive. A hosted gateway times a request out when nothing crosses
//      the wire, and a timeline jump is the longest request the game makes — a
//      ~190 KB prompt asking for 30+ events, which at an observed 27 chars/s is
//      tens of minutes. A buffered tool call sends zero bytes for that whole
//      span, so a proxy closes it: the field report behind this was a 502 at
//      exactly 301.7s on a healthy endpoint. Streamed, each delta resets the
//      idle timer.
//
// Anthropic makes the second point sharper: it REFUSES a non-streaming request
// whose max_tokens implies a long generation, and the game sends max_tokens
// 64000 uncapped, so those jumps could be rejected before generating at all.
//
// Each reader also takes an `onToolProgress` hook, which is how a time skip shows
// its events arriving one by one (streamedEvents.js). It fires as the tool call's
// arguments grow, with `json` for partial-JSON text or `args`+`paths` for the
// object partialArgs fragments build. Purely an observer: what it does or throws
// can never change the envelope returned here.
//
// Separate from main.jsx (which pulls in the whole browser runtime and so cannot
// be unit-tested) for the same reason as jsonSalvage.js, providerErrors.js and
// geminiSchema.js. Its one import, streamedEvents.js, imports nothing, so this
// still runs under bare node. The frame reducers are exported separately from
// the readers so tests can drive them frame by frame: a tool call split
// mid-argument, or a stream that ends halfway through one, is otherwise unreachable.

// SSE plumbing

// Reads an SSE body and hands each `data:` payload to onFrame as parsed JSON.
// Non-JSON and keep-alive lines are skipped rather than thrown on: a gateway
// that injects comments or padding must not break a turn.
//
// `onActivity` fires once per network chunk — before the chunk is parsed, and
// whether or not it contained a whole frame. It is what "Limit AI generation"
// counts (idleDeadline.js): the question that setting asks is whether anything
// is still arriving, and a keep-alive comment or half a frame answers it just as
// well as a token does. Wrapped like the onChunk callbacks, since a throwing UI
// callback must never cost the player a turn.
