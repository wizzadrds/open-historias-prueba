// This decides what one government may know about another, so its two failure
// directions are not equal. Hiding something a polity should have seen costs a

// not have seen is the breach chatVisibility.js was written to end — Angola
// quoting the player's private letter to Nigeria. Every ambiguous case below is
// therefore pinned on the side of hiding.
