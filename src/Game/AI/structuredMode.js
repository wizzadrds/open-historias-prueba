// WHICH WAY to ask a model for structured data, and learning which way actually
// works for the endpoint in front of you.
//
// There are four, in descending order of how strongly the answer is guaranteed:
//
//   tool         "call this function with these arguments" — the provider
//                enforces the schema. Best, and the default first choice.
//   json_schema  "reply with JSON matching this schema" — provider-validated.
//   json_object  "reply with valid JSON" — loosely enforced.
//   text_json    the schema pasted into the prompt — nothing enforces it at all,
//                it is simply asked for.
//
// callOpenAIStyleChatCompletions walks that list downward when a rung fails, and
// that ladder is what stopped a badly-behaved endpoint from costing the player
// whole turns. But it starts from the top on EVERY call, so it rediscovers the
// same failure over and over: on one measured 1-year turn, seven separate ladder
// walks accounted for ~740 of 1419 seconds, all of it re-learning that an NVIDIA
// endpoint accepts tool_choice:"required" and then does not enforce it.
//
// The obvious fix — silently remember and skip — was considered and rejected.
// It trades correctness for speed on a guess about someone else's server: one
// unrelated blip would demote every later call out of the strongest channel, and
// the degradation would be invisible. Instead the ladder OBSERVES, and once it
// has seen the same answer twice it offers the player the setting. The app does
// the discovery; the player makes the decision.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE, like providerErrors.js and jsonSalvage.js: the
// promotion rule is small, consequential, and exactly the kind of thing that
// wants direct tests. main.jsx cannot be unit-tested at all.

// Strongest first. Index order IS the ladder.

// game offers to speed things up. The technical names are kept only because they
