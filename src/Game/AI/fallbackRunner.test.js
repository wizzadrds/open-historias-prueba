// The Fallback list's rules (docs/world-state.md, "AI access"; ADR 0001):
// every call starts at the top and moves down only when an entry cannot answer.
// A short mark — busy, rate limited — says what a row shows, never where a call
// begins: it is worth one fast refusal to find out it has cleared. A Spent one
// does move the start, because its reset is hours away, but it only sinks to
// the back: the call still reaches it when nothing else has answered.
// fallbackRunner.js is import-free, so these drive it with a fake attempt and a
// fake clock — no network, no storage.
