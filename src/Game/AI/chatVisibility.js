// Who is allowed to have read which conversation.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX. The `leader` prompt renders
// ${CHATS_NON_CONSOLIDATED_ROUNDS} — a verbatim transcript of every recent chat,
// regardless of who was in it. So every AI leader was handed the player's private
// letters to every OTHER power. There was no such thing as a confidential channel:
// a player could not make a secret offer, could not play two powers against each
// other, and could not promise different things in different rooms, because every
// room was public.
//
// It surfaced as tone rather than as an error, which is why it survived so long.
// From a round-356 campaign, three letters written on one in-game day:
//
//   Algeria — "...we walk away having lost nothing but time. Send your delegation.
//              Algiers will read every page."
//   Nigeria — "...we walk away having lost nothing but time. Send your delegation
//              in January. Nigeria will read every page."
//   Angola  — "Angola will examine every clause for hidden sovereignty costs before
//              any signature, JUST AS OUR NEIGHBOURS HAVE LEARNED TO DO."
//
// Angola's clause is the diagnosis in plain sight: it is reasoning openly from
// correspondence it should never have seen. (For the record, this is not prompt
// caching — that caches the INPUT KV state and cannot make two polities share an
// output. The two are unrelated.)
//
// THE RULE. Filter every transcript by who the prompt is speaking as:
//
//   leader          -> one polity  -> only chats that polity was in
//   advisor         -> the player  -> everything (the player is in every chat, so
//                                     passing no filter is the correct no-op)
//   jumpForward     -> the narrator-> everything; it must resolve what actually
//                                     happened across the whole world
//   eventConsolidator -> archivist -> everything
//
// A chat's `countries` lists the NON-PLAYER participants (a 1-on-1 with Angola is
// `[{code:"AGO",name:"Angola"}]`; the player is implicit), so "was this polity in
// the room?" is answerable directly, with no new data and no migration.
//
// DELIBERATELY FREE OF RUNTIME IMPORTS, like jsonSalvage.js / providerErrors.js:
// this decides what one government is allowed to know about another, and
// promptContext.js reaches the whole browser runtime and cannot be unit-tested.
//
// The rule itself now lives in audience.js, which is equally bare: "who is
// looking" became a value that a lookup function or a report's distribution list
// can be asked about too, rather than something only chats understood. This file
// keeps its names, its history and its one legacy convenience — a blank polity
// meaning the narrator — so nothing that called it had to change.
