// Runs without node_modules: chatVisibility.js imports only audience.js, which
// imports nothing.
//
// This module decides what one government is allowed to know about another, so
// the two failure directions are NOT equal:
//   showing a chat a polity was not in  = the confidentiality breach (the bug)
//   hiding a chat a polity WAS in       = a leader forgets a conversation
// The first is silent and corrupts the whole diplomatic game; the second is
// visible and recoverable. Ambiguity must therefore resolve to HIDDEN.
