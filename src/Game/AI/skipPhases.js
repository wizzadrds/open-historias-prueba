// Run the tests: node --test src/Game/AI/skipPhases.test.js
//
// A skip is a handful of distinct pieces of work — reading the world, writing
// the events, the one review request, placing the armies and fronts, writing it
// all into the record, the board, the history — and the player was shown one
// word for all of it: "Simulating…". A 25-second skip that says nothing for 25
// seconds reads as a hung one; the review request that takes six of them is
// indistinguishable from the jump request that takes fifteen. And afterwards the
// log said how long the whole turn took and how many requests it used, never
// where either went.
//
// So the skip enters each phase by name as it starts it. The panel shows the
// phase's own words while it runs (D10), and when the skip lands the log gets
// one line: each phase, its time, and the requests made inside it (F5) — "25.8 s
// — reading the world 1.1 s · writing 1 month of events 16.9 s (1 request) ·
// checking the moves 6.2 s (1 request) · …". A phase entered twice (the writing
// of each segment) is one line, its times added.
//
// Import-free, with the clock and the request count handed in, so it is tested
// under bare node and the skip keeps its one budget as the source of truth.
