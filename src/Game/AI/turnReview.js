/*! Open Historia — the turn review: every check after a time skip, in one request © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// After a time skip the game used to make a separate request for each thing it
// checks: one to move the units the events talk about, one to mark occupied and
// disputed land, one to take repeats and filler off the timeline, one to move
// the Projects board, and one per deployed agent for its report. Five jobs, five
// or more requests, on a key that may allow a few hundred a day
// (requestBudget.js).
//
// The jobs do not depend on each other's ANSWERS, only on the same events. So
// they go out together: one request whose prompt is the jobs' own prompts, each
// complete and fenced off from the others, and whose answer is one object with
// a field per job. Each field is then checked and used exactly as that job's
// own request would have been — by the same schema, the same native rules — and
// a job whose field is missing or malformed fails open by itself (the units
// stay where the simulator put them, every event is kept, the board does not
// move) without costing the others theirs.
//
// This file is the part of that which is plain text and data: putting the jobs
// into one prompt and one output function, taking the answer apart, and moving
// the board's event numbers from the list the review was shown to the list the
// turn ended up with. gameplay.js decides which jobs a skip needs, and runs it.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE.
