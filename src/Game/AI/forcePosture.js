// What every power's forces are doing, written out so the advisor can answer
// "Russian units are getting very close to Ukraine's border, what do you think?"
// from facts rather than from geography it has to infer out of bare lat/lng.
//
// The advisor was already handed the whole unit list — buildUnitsSummaryText,
// despite the helper being named PLAYER_POLITY_BATTALION_SUMMARIES, has never
// filtered by owner. The problem was that it arrived under a heading reading
// "Player polity, X, details: ... Military Units:", so the model read it as the
// player's own army and never used it to answer questions about anyone else.
// This replaces that with something explicitly about everybody, and adds the
// three things the model cannot work out for itself: whose territory a formation
// is in, how far it is from whose border, and what it is already under orders to do.
//
// DELIBERATELY free of browser-only imports, so it can be tested without a full
// install (see forcePosture.test.js). That includes createTerritoryIndex at the
// bottom: territoryOutlines.js does nothing but fetch and decode the region
// tile, then hands the rings here, which keeps the border geometry testable
// without the map binaries.
