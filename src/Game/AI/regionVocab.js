/*! Open Historia — region ownership vocabulary for AI prompts © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */

// Why this exists: the jump prompt tells the model the map description contains
// "every polity, region ... separated by a comma ... ANALYZE THIS INCREDIBLY
// CAREFULLY", but the variable behind it (buildWorldSummary) only ever enumerated
// the regionOwnershipOverrides list (truncated to 24) and NOTHING on a stock map.
// So the model was told a full region vocabulary was present, given none, and
// forced to INVENT region names — which then fail resolveRegionTransfers' exact
// name/id match and get silently dropped, so a narrated capture never moves the map.
//
// The naive fix — dump all ~3000 GADM regions every jump — bloats the prompt and
// hands the model thousands of names it does not need this turn. Instead this is
// TIERED so the model gets names where it actually needs them, without "every name
// at once":
//
//   Section 1 (FULL `name (id)` lists): only the powers currently IN PLAY — the
//     player, anyone already re-owned via an override, scenario-defined actors, and
//     the player's active chat partners. These are the likely belligerents, so the
//     model can emit a resolvable transfer on the FIRST attempt.
//   Section 2 (NAMES ONLY, no province names): every other owner, as
//     `Name — N regions`. This gives the model the fromCode/toCode vocabulary
//     for the long tail WITHOUT listing thousands of province names. When it targets
//     one of these, it names the region as best it can and resolveRegionTransfers'
//     retry (buildTransferFeedback, made reliable by the ownerKeyOf base-owner
//     fallback) hands back that power's exact names — on demand, within the same jump.
//
// Every owner in both sections is the FULL COUNTRY NAME. GADM's codes are provenance
// on the region row, never an identity: the model is only ever shown, and only ever
// asked for, "Spain".
//
// A region's owner is `regionOwnershipOverrides[id] ?? region.country` (the base
// country from the catalog), so ownership is non-empty on stock maps, not just on
// re-ownership scenarios. The catalog `name` is the exact in-game name the resolver
// keys on (a GADM NAME_1 endonym like "Bayern"/"Ostpreussen"), so listing it — rather
// than relying on the model's exonym guess ("Bavaria") — is what makes the transfer
// resolvable.
//
// Unit-tested directly (regionVocab.test.js) without pulling in the browser-only asset
// layer that promptContext.js imports — its only import is the owner-name
// canonicaliser, which is plain data and safe to load anywhere.

// The in-game owner of a region, ALWAYS as the full country name ("Spain"): an
// explicit override wins, else the base country from the catalog (so stock maps
// report real ownership, not ""). It used to answer with the GADM CODE, which is
// where the model learned to write "ESP" — and since a transfer's owner is stored
// verbatim, that minted a phantom "ESP" country beside the real Spain. A legacy
// override still holding a code is canonicalised here rather than handed on.
// It also has to be the name for the FOCUS matching to work at all: the focus set is
// built from the player's country and chat partners, which are names, so a code here
// never matched and the player's own regions were left out of the enumerated list.
