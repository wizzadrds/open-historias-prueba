// An audience is who a prompt, a lookup or a transcript is being put together
// FOR. There are only two kinds:
//
//   simulation  the narrator. It resolves what actually happened across the whole
//               world, so it sees everything: every chat, every agent, every
//               secret. The jump, the consolidator and the curator are this.
//
//   viewer      one or more polities, and nothing they could not know. A leader
//               speaking as Angola is a viewer of ["Angola"]. The player's advisor
//               is a viewer of the player's polity.
//
// chatVisibility.js introduced the idea for one thing (which chats a leader has
// read) after a field report in which Angola quoted the player's private letter
// to Nigeria. This is the same rule as a value that can be passed around, so the
// next thing that needs it — a lookup function, a report's distribution list — asks
// the same question the same way instead of growing a private copy of it.
//
// TWO RULES, both inherited from that module and both deliberate:
//
//   1. FAIL CLOSED. Whatever cannot be placed is hidden from a viewer. The cost of
//      wrongly hiding something is a leader that forgets a conversation, which is
//      visible and recoverable. The cost of wrongly showing it is the breach.
//
//   2. THE NARRATOR IS SAID OUT LOUD. There is no "blank means everything" here. A
//      caller that wants everything passes SIMULATION_AUDIENCE. normalizeAudience
//      does accept a blank for callers that predate this module (chatVisibility's
//      documented opt-out), but it is the only place that does, and new code
//      should never rely on it.
//
// Import-free on purpose: this decides what one government may know about
// another, and it has to be testable under bare node.
