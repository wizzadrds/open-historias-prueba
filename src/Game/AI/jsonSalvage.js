// writes prose containing a brace after its JSON, or emits two objects; walking
// candidates and parsing each one survives both.
//
// A block left OPEN when the text runs out yielded nothing at all, so a turn
// whose only flaw was a forgotten closing bracket — the model opening two
// arrays around a mimicked tool call and closing one — was discarded whole to
// the canned fallback. That one shape gets its missing closers appended and is
// offered as a last-resort candidate, after every intact block.
//
// The repair is deliberately narrow, because the alternative is worse than the
// fallback: closing off a response that was genuinely cut off mid-flight would
// apply a shortened turn — some of the events, some of the projectOps — while
// presenting it as the whole thing. A turn either lands as the model wrote it
// or it falls back; it never half-lands. So a fragment is repaired ONLY when
// appending the closers cannot change its content, which needs all three:
//   - the text ends outside a string, on a closed value (`}` or `]`), so no
//     token is sitting half-written;
//   - every unclosed container is an ARRAY — an unclosed object is missing a
//     key/value pair by definition, so its content is not yet knowable;
//   - each of those arrays holds exactly ONE member (no comma at its level),
//     which is the tool-call envelope and nothing else. Two members means the
//     model was mid-list and a third may have been lost.
// Anything else — mid-string, mid-number, a dangling comma, an open object, a
// half-written array — is left unparseable on purpose.
