// The Fallback list's rules, in one place (docs/world-state.md, "AI access").
//
// Every AI call starts at the top of the player's Fallback list and uses the
// first entry that can answer. It moves down only when an entry cannot: it is
// Spent, Unusable, or busy for a moment. It never spreads calls across entries
// to get more usage — see docs/adr/0001-fallback-never-rotation.md before
// changing anything about the order.
//
// And every call starts at the top again (2026-09-19): an entry that failed a
// moment ago is still tried first next time, because a rate limit is usually
// over by then, and a call that skipped it would run on a weaker model for
// nothing.
//
// Except where the provider has SAID the entry is out for now: a Spent one
// (2026-09-20), whose allowance it told us is gone until a reset hours away,
// and a BUSY one (2026-09-21). The busy rule used to be the other way — "a busy
// spell is usually over in seconds, and guessing wrong costs one fast
// refusal" — until a night on which the refusals were not fast: a 503 that
// took 68 seconds to arrive, three of them in a row before a model answered,
// 101 of a jump's 114 seconds spent being told no, and a retry that a busy
// model did not refuse but served in 191 seconds. So a busy entry sits out for
// ten minutes, at the owner's word, and a Spent one until its reset; both sink
// to the BACK of the order rather than out of it: nothing above them answering
// means the guess is worth making after all, and a mark that has quietly
// expired must never be the thing that fails a turn.
//
// Unusable keeps its place, because its mark has no reset to wait for — it is
// cleared by the player fixing the entry (providerConfig.js) or by a later call
// simply working, and a provider that returned one 401 in a bad moment must be
// able to heal itself that way. So does Rate limited: a per-minute limit is
// over within the minute, and the mark is what a Settings row shows.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE, like providerErrors.js: main.jsx makes the calls and
// cannot be unit-tested, and these rules are exactly what needs to be. The
// caller hands in the list, where entry states are kept, a clock, and one
// function that makes one call on one entry.

// Remembers entry states in memory, for the tests. The game keeps the real one
// in localStorage (providerConfig.js fallbackStateStore); both have this shape.
