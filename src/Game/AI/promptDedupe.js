/*! Open Historia — call-time directive de-duplication © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// Deciding whether a call-time directive still needs to be appended, or whether
// the rendered prompt already says it.
//
// Why this exists: several rules are concatenated onto the system prompt in
// runJsonTask rather than living in defaultPrompts.json, because existing
// campaigns carry a FROZEN copy of their prompt pack and a JSON edit never
// reaches them (see docs/ai-prompts.md §2). That works, but a game seeded from a
// current default then carries the rule in its template AND gets it appended
// again — paying twice for it on every jump.
//
// The waste is the smaller half of the problem. The same rule in two slightly
// different wordings invites the model to look for a distinction that is not
// there, which is the opposite of what a duplicated safety rule is for.
//
// DELIBERATELY IMPORT-FREE, like jumpSegments.js and jsonSalvage.js: the
// consequence of getting this wrong is asymmetric and invisible at runtime — a
// false negative merely restores today's harmless duplicate, but a false
// positive silently DELETES a rule from the prompt and nothing downstream would
// report it. That asymmetry is exactly what wants direct tests, and gameplay.js
// reaches the whole browser runtime and cannot be tested at all.

/**
 * Does `renderedPrompt` already contain `marker`?
 *
 * Whitespace-collapsed and case-insensitive, so a scenario author who reflowed
 * the paragraph or changed its capitalisation still counts as having the rule.
 * Deliberately nothing cleverer: markers are chosen to be long and specific
 * rather than fuzzy-matched, because the cost of a wrong "yes" is a missing rule.

// The scenario's pre-round-one briefing reaches the prompt by two routes: the
// task text renders ${WORLD_BEFORE_ROUND_ONE_TEXT} directly, AND buildWorldSummary
// embeds the same string in the world snapshot. Eight of the sixteen prompts
// render both, so both copies go every call. On a real campaign that is 107,870
// characters sent twice - about 35% of a jump prompt spent saying the same thing
// a second time.
//
// It cannot be fixed by editing the templates: existing campaigns carry frozen
// copies, and two tasks (countryStatSheet, actions) reach the briefing ONLY
// through the world summary, so removing it there would take it away from them
// entirely. Collapsing the repeat after the prompt is assembled fixes every save
// at once and cannot take anything away from a prompt that only had it once.
//
// The FIRST occurrence is the one kept, so the briefing still appears in the
// position the prompt's own prose introduces it.

// Long enough that a repeat is certainly the same block rather than a coincidence,
// and short enough to catch a modest briefing. A placeholder like "No pre-game
// world briefing was provided." must never be de-duplicated: it is not bulk, and
// replacing it with a pointer would read as though something had been omitted.
