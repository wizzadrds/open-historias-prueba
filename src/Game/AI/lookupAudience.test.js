// Three lookup functions answer from material a government keeps to itself:
// chat_history (the player's correspondence), spy_network (every agent in the
// world) and list_projects (covert operations included). They took no viewer at
// all. That was safe only by accident — every task that carries lookups is the
// narrator — and it was the one place where handing lookups to a surface that
// speaks AS a polity would have let it read the player's letters to everyone
// else through a function call. chatVisibility.js closed that door for prompts;
// this closes it for functions.
//
// The narrator's answers must not change by a byte.
