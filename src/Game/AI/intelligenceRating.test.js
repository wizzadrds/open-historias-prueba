// Run: node --test src/Game/AI/intelligenceRating.test.js
//
// Reported: a player built spy training academies and researched the tech for a
// dozen turns and the 🕵 Intelligence service bar never moved. Every link below
// was already sound — the model was simply never shown the current rating, so it
// never emitted a change (gameplay.js buildPlayerPolityIntelligenceText now does
// for intelligence what the reputation block has always done for reputation).
// These tests pin the mechanical chain that fix depends on, end to end: the tool
// schema must accept the field, the normalizer must keep it, applying the event
// must store it, and the espionage maths must read it back.
