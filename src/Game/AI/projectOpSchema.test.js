//
// The six-variant anyOf that used to describe impacts.projectOps was 41.5 KB
// serialized — 66% of the whole jump tool schema — because three of its variants
// each restated projectSchema in full. It collapsed to one object discriminated
// by `op`.
//
// This file is the safety net for that collapse: EVERY op shape the old schema
// accepted must still validate, because a payload the schema rejects costs the
// player the whole turn, not just the one op. The shapes below are taken from
// what the old variants declared and from the fixtures in
// src/runtime/projectOps.test.js, which exercises the reducer these feed.
