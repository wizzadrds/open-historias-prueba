// Reads gameplay.js as TEXT rather than importing it, and that is deliberate.
//
// applySimulationResult is not exported, and exporting it purely to test it would
// mean building an entire turn's worth of fixtures to assert something that is
// really a statement about ORDER. What matters here cannot be observed from
// outside the function anyway: three steps have to happen in one sequence, and
// every one of them is invisible if they do not.
//
// These are the cheapest possible guards against a refactor quietly undoing work
// that has no other alarm. Each failure message says what breaks, because a test
// that only says "order changed" is worse than no test.
