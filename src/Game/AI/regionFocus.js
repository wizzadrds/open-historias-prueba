// rest as counts. Until now that few was chosen by accident: the player, then
// whichever owners happened to come first in the save's override map — on the
// Fault Lines world that meant Panama, China, India, Somaliland, France and
// Sweden while the player was fighting Russia over Ukraine, whose regions the
// model therefore had to guess. Guessed names failed to resolve and the
// annexation never reached the map.
//
// This ranks the powers by what the turn is actually about: the player, whoever
// the player's pending actions name, the belligerents of active wars, the
// player's chat partners, the powers the recent events moved or mentioned, the
// claimants of contested regions, and only then size. Import-free.
//
// Every match here is on a name the map declares, spelled out in full. Prose
// that says "Russia" on a world whose power is the "Russian Federation" (and
// nothing called "Russia") names nobody; the two are different countries
// wherever both exist. Ranking is never allowed to blur that line.
