// Lookup tools: what the model can ASK for instead of being handed everything.
//
// A structured task (a timeline jump, a game-master command, action
// suggestions) used to receive the whole campaign inline and then guess the
// exact names and ids it needed for map operations. With these tools declared
// beside the task's output tool, the model looks things up first — the exact
// powers on the map, one power's regions, a region by name, a region's
// neighbours, a city's region, a power's situation, recent events, the war
// ledger, a chat, the units — and only then calls the output tool. Every
// answer here is built from the live campaign and the rendered map, and every
// name in it is spelled as the map spells it.
//
// Import-light on purpose: the executor is a pure function of a context the
// caller builds (lookupContext), so it runs in node tests and in the harness.
