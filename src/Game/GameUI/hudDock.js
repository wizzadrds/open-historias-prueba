// The dock is the rounded pill at the bottom left holding the launchers: Chat,
// Actions, Projects & Operations. Its width is a function of how many there
// are, and the Search control sits just to the right of it.
//
// That width used to be a literal in chat.jsx and a second literal in
// search.jsx, with a comment asking the next person to keep them in step. They
// drifted when Projects was added, and again when a Dossier launcher was (since
// removed: documents now reach the player through diplomacy, spies and events),
// and that time Search ended up sitting ON TOP of the new button. So the number
// lives here and both files derive from it: a launcher added or removed moves
// Search on its own.

// The pill itself.
