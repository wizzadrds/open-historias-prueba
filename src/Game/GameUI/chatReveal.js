//
// The timing of a group turn said a line at a time (AI/chatActions.js
// planChatReveal). The first step is said when the turn arrives; each later one
// waits `pauseMs` while its speaker is shown typing, then is said. The panel
// (chat.jsx) says a step by writing it into the thread, so a step not said yet
// exists only here — and stopping, when the player cuts in or leaves the
// thread, hands back what is left, for the panel to drop or to say at once.
//
// Import-free, with the clock passed in, so the timing is tested under node.

// `onTyping(step)` is called when a step's speaker starts typing, and with null
// when nobody is; `onSay(step)` says a step and returns false when it could not
// (the turn then ends: nothing after it can be said either); `onEnd()` is called
// once, however the turn ends.
