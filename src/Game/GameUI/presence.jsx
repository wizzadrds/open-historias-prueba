// A surface that is conditionally rendered vanishes the instant its flag turns
// false, which is the one thing CSS alone cannot animate. Presence keeps the
// children mounted for one short exit animation after `open` turns false, and
// marks that phase on a boxless wrapper so styles.css can play the exit on the
// surface itself:
//
//   [data-oh-presence="leaving"] > * { animation: oh-surface-out ... }
//
// Two ways to give it children:
//   <Presence open={flag}>{...jsx...}</Presence>
//     (leaveMs lengthens the exit for a surface with a longer animation)
//     for a surface whose content does not depend on a value that is null
//     while it is closed (the JSX is built by the parent on every render);
//   <Presence open={Boolean(item)} value={item}>{(item) => ...jsx...}</Presence>
//     for one that does: the function runs only while mounted, and during
//     the exit it is handed the last value the surface was open with.
//
// Portalled surfaces are not DOM children of the wrapper; they read
// usePresenceLeaving() and apply the exit class themselves.
//
// Entrances need no help: every positioned surface fades in through the
// attribute rules in styles.css, and the bigger ones add .oh-surface-in.
