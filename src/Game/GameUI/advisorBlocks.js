// reaches assets.js -> maplibre-gl, so nothing in it can be unit-tested, and this
// is exactly the kind of string handling that needs to be. DELIBERATELY
// IMPORT-FREE, the same trick eventFocus.js uses, so its tests run in a bare
// checkout — which is also why the repairs below are reimplemented here rather
// than imported from gameplay.js's lenientJsonParse, whose behaviour they mirror.

//
//   - Smart quotes. A model whose prose is full of typographic punctuation writes
//     JSON the same way, and one ” anywhere in a long array kills the whole block.
//     This is the FIRST suspect whenever a well-fenced block will not parse.
//   - Trailing commas before } or ].
//   - // and /* */ comments, which chatty models add to "explain" their payload.
//   - A wrapper object: {"projects": [...]} instead of a bare array.
//
// Repairs run ONLY after a strict parse fails, so well-formed output is never
// touched — the same discipline extractJsonPayload follows.

// in it. The references do this with a typed output function per chart and a
// receipt that says whether it rendered; here the fence stays (it works on every
// provider, a function only where functions do), and the two things the fence
// was missing are added:
//
//   - a check BEFORE it is drawn. AdvisorChart read config.data.datasets
//     unguarded, so a config without data threw during render — a broken
//     bubble at best. A chart that fails the check is not drawn; the panel says
//     why in a line of its own.
//   - a receipt. The advisor never learned that a chart did not draw, or that
//     its actions or board block half landed, and would build on it. What went
