// The Projects & Operations board: every long-running effort the player has going
// — research and industrial programmes, construction projects, military and
// covert operations — plus whatever their services have learned of other powers'.
//
// The player cannot author an entry's CONTENT here, deliberately. Two things
// write what a project is: events, through impacts.projectOps on any
// jump/GM/interactive event turn, and the advisor, through the ```projects block in a chat
// reply. A board the player could hand-edit would be a wishlist; this one is a
// readout of what the simulation actually believes is happening.
//
// Two things the player DOES own, and only these two: a project's priority — how
// much attention they want it to get, which the jump and advisor prompts then act
// on — and whether to abandon it outright. Neither invents or rewrites anything;
// they are the difference between a board of thirty programmes being steerable and
// being a wall. Both go through applyProjectOpsToWorld, the same door the advisor
// uses, rather than hand-editing the array: the ops pipeline is what stamps
// updatedAt/updatedRound (so an abandoned project does not immediately reappear
// wearing a "no recent progress" badge) and what closes out dangling milestones.
//
// And both belong to THEIR OWN work only. Roughly half a mature board is other
// powers' programmes, tracked because the player's services have learned of them,
// and a priority dial or an Abandon button on a rival's shipyard says the player
// commands it. So a foreign card carries neither control, the ops door is called
// with actor "player" so a stale render cannot get round that, and the advisor and
// jump prompts are told to refuse the same request in words — with the one opening
// that makes sense, which is opening the player's OWN counter-effort against it.
//
// Because of that split the board opens on Mine. A player who wants the rival
// column asks for it; the default view is the work they can actually steer.
//
// Everything date-derived (overdue, due soon, a slipped milestone, a programme
// nobody has mentioned in three rounds) is computed here from the game clock by
// runtime/projects.js, NOT read off what the model last wrote. That is what keeps
// the board honest between AI turns.
