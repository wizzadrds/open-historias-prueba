// Brings a saved map document forward when the owner scheme changes.
//
// A document written before the rename owns its regions by GADM code ("MNG"), and
// keys colorOverrides / flags / tags the same way. Opened as-is in an editor that
// speaks names, every one of those lookups misses: the map renders in procedural
// hash colours instead of its palette, and the first edit to a country forks it in
// two — the region says "MNG" while the field you just typed says "Mongolia".
//
// Worse, it does not stay in the editor. Applying such a document to a scenario
// writes `world: { ...currentWorld, ... }`, so the code-keyed payload INHERITS the
// target's ownerSchema marker and the store's migration — the one thing that could
// have repaired it — never runs. A document is the one place legacy owners can
// enter the system already wearing a "migrated" badge, which is why this exists
// here rather than in the store.

// The registry alone is enough here, and rules 2-4 of the store's resolver are not
// available anyway: a document has no scenario meta and no polityOverrides. Every
// one of the 239 modern GADM codes resolves; anything else (an FMG world's
// "Yardibyurt", a country someone invented) is already its own name and passes
// through untouched — which is exactly what rule 5 would have done.
