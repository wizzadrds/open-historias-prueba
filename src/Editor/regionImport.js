// Loads seeded region geometry into an OpenLayers vector source.

// scripts/extract-regions.mjs (a tile stitch of regions.pmtiles). It is WGS84
// lon/lat; we reproject into the editor's Web-Mercator view on read. Each region
// starts owned by its own country — owner = the country's NAME ("Russia"), not
// its GADM code — so an imported world renders exactly like the game's political
// map; the user re-owns/edits from there.
