Open Historia is a free, open-source grand strategy game. You take a country on a world map,
write your orders in plain English, and skip time forward. A language model plays the rest of
the world — every other country's leader, the events that befall them, the wars they start and
the deals they cut — and hands you back a history of what happened.

It is not a game with a tech tree and a build queue. There are no ticks and no clock running
down. **Nothing happens until you decide to advance time**, and when you do, the world moves as
far as you asked and tells you about it.

## Start here

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-tag"><a href="/wiki/install/">1. Install the game</a></div>
  <div class="feature-tag"><a href="/wiki/ai-setup/">2. Connect an AI provider</a></div>
  <div class="feature-tag"><a href="/wiki/how-to-play/">3. Learn the loop</a></div>
  <div class="feature-tag"><a href="/wiki/first-campaign/">4. Play your first campaign</a></div>
</div>

You need step 2. Open Historia ships with no model of its own and does not sell you one — you
bring a key from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic or any compatible service, or you point it at a model
running on your own machine. Without one, the game still opens and the map still works, but the
world stops responding: time skips fall back to canned events and the advisor cannot answer.
Google's free tier is enough for solo play, and a local model costs nothing at all.

## Deep dives

Every system, with the actual rules and numbers rather than a summary.

## Things worth knowing up front

**There is no multiplayer.** Open Historia is a single-player game. You can host it on your own
machine and reach it from your phone or another computer on the same network, and you can share
scenarios with other players through the [Community Hub](/wiki/community-hub/) — but there is no
lobby, no shared session and no simultaneous turns. Anything you have read elsewhere describing
a multiplayer lobby is wrong.

**Your API key never leaves your machine.** Provider settings live in your browser's local
storage, or in the desktop app's own profile. No Open Historia server ever sees it. On the
desktop build, requests to providers that refuse browser calls are relayed through the local
server, which listens on loopback only unless you deliberately open it up.

**The game is only as good as the model.** Diplomacy, events, combat adjudication and the
advisor are all model output. A larger model gives you a world that remembers what it did last
turn and reacts in character; a very small local model will give you a thinner one. See
[AI providers and models](/wiki/ai-providers/) for what to pick.

**Some features are beta-only.** Pages and sections marked <em>beta</em> describe systems that
have not reached the stable release. The beta build installs alongside the stable app and keeps
its own saves, so trying it costs you nothing.

## If something is broken

Start with [Troubleshooting](/wiki/troubleshooting/) — it covers the common ones: a blank map,
greyed-out AI, turns that take forever, and CORS errors from a local model. Beyond that, the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/QaqAK7fQAg) is the fastest place to get help, and bugs go to
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia/issues).
