Open Historia saves continuously. There is no save button, and there is no way to lose an hour
of play to a crash.

![The games library](/wiki/img/saves-library.jpg)
*The Games tab. Each card carries its country, date and round; **Current** opens it, and its **⋮** holds Edit, Clone and Export.*

## Games and scenarios

Two different things, and the distinction matters:

- A **scenario** is a world — the map, the borders, who owns what, the start date, the available
  troop types, the author's house rules. It never changes when you play.
- A **game** is one playthrough of a scenario. It starts as a copy of that world and diverges
  from the first turn.

One scenario seeds as many games as you like. Editing a scenario later does not touch games
already running on it.

## Autosave

Every time skip writes the whole campaign — world state, game state, events, your order queue,
chat history and the colour palette — and then captures a rollback snapshot.

There is nothing to do and nothing to remember. Closing the game mid-turn loses at most the
orders you had typed but not queued.

## Undo and rollback

**↩ Undo last turn**, in the time panel, restores everything to how it was before the last jump.
The game keeps **12** turns of snapshots, so you can step back repeatedly. The panel tells you
how many are available.

**Roll Back Turn**, in the [cheats panel](/wiki/cheats/), jumps straight to the start of any
earlier turn in the stack and discards everything after it.

Both restore the full campaign, not just the map — the events, the conversations, your queued
orders, your agents' reports and any papers that reached you all come back as they were. Your
standing goal is yours rather than the turn's, so it stays as it is now.

Use undo freely. See [time and turns](/wiki/time/).

## Cloning

Both games and scenarios can be cloned from their card in the library — a game from its **⋮**,
a scenario with **Clone Scenario**.

Cloning a **game** is the closest thing to a manual save slot: fork the campaign before doing
something reckless, and you keep both branches. Cloning a **scenario** gives you an editable copy
of someone else's world.

## Where saves live

**Desktop and self-hosted** — files on disk, in the app's own data directory. You can back the
directory up like any other folder.

**Browser** — in your browser's storage. This is the one to be careful with: **clearing site data
clears your campaigns.** The game will ask for persistent storage permission when you first
play, and you should grant it.

**Android** — on the phone, in the app's storage.

The beta desktop build keeps a **completely separate** library from the stable one. Installing
the beta cannot touch your stable campaigns, and vice versa.

## Moving a campaign between machines

**Games export as one zip.** On a game's card, **⋮ → Export** saves `<name>-game.zip`: the world,
the clock, events, chats, actions, the advisor's conversation, prompts, colours, flags, tags,
intercepts — and every rollback snapshot, so the campaign can be continued and undone on the other
side, not just looked at. The card says so while the zip is being built. **Import game**, in the
Games tab's header, brings one back; it lands right beside your current game, marked
**(Imported)** if its name collides with one you already have.

The scenario travels only when it has to. A built-in scenario is not included (everyone has it),
nor one that came from the Community Hub (it can be fetched again). A map too large to carry — over
32 MB — is left out rather than crashing the export; the game still exports, and the receiver ends
up in the same position as a game whose scenario is missing. A game whose scenario is gone is still
listed, opens in the editor, and can still be exported.

**Scenarios** export and import as a `.zip` bundle carrying the map, cities, colours, flags and
any custom basemap, or as plain `.json`. Use **Import JSON** in the Scenarios tab's header, or the
**Download** buttons in a scenario's editor drawer. **Create Scenario** starts a blank one from the
base template and drops you straight into its editor. This is also how you
[publish to the Community Hub](/wiki/community-hub/).

On the stable Android app a file cannot be saved, so export is not offered there.

<p class="beta-note"><b>On beta the Android app exports too</b>, through Android's share
sheet.</p>

## Syncing between devices

Only in the browser build at [openhistoria.com/play/](/play/), and only if you sign in. The
desktop app and a self-hosted server do not sync — they keep files on disk.

**Signing in.** There is no password. Use the sign-in chip in the top-right corner and either
enter an email address to be sent a magic link, or sign in with Google. Both land you in the
same account.

**What syncs.** Your games and your scenarios, with the library listings that order them.
Map-editor documents and custom basemaps do *not* sync yet. Sync runs on sign-in, then every 20
seconds, and again whenever you switch away from the tab.

**How the encryption works.** On your first ever sign-in the browser generates a random
encryption key, and every game and scenario is encrypted with it *before* it is uploaded. The
server only ever receives ciphertext — it never sees a save in the clear.

That key is then held by the server in wrapped form, which is what lets you sign in on a second
device and read your own campaigns there. So this is not a zero-knowledge system: it protects
your saves in transit and at rest, and it means a database leak is useless on its own, but the
service can obtain the key. Do not treat it as a secret vault.

**The one thing that can lose work.** If the same game is edited on two devices without syncing
in between, the copy already on the server wins and the local one is replaced. There is no merge
and no prompt. In practice: let a device finish syncing before you pick up the same campaign
somewhere else. Playing different games on different devices is entirely safe.

**Large scenarios may not upload.** A scenario carrying its own map data can exceed the current
size limit and is skipped, with a warning in the browser console, until larger blob storage is
switched on. Its games still sync.

Your API key is never synced. Provider settings are per device.

## Archiving

**Archive**, on a game's card, takes it out of the main library view without throwing it away, and the same
button becomes **Unarchive** to bring it back. Useful once you have accumulated a dozen
half-finished campaigns.

## What a save contains

For the curious: five documents per game — the world, the game state, the events, the actions
queue and the chat history — plus siblings for colours, flags, tags, rollback snapshots, advisor
history and intercepts, and the map geometry.

Intercepts are the exception to "it is all just JSON": they are
[encrypted at rest](/wiki/espionage/) with a key unique to the campaign.
