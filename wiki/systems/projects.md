Some things a country does cannot happen in one turn. A nuclear programme, a canal, a rearmament
plan, a decade-long insurgency, a covert operation to destabilise a neighbour — these are
*efforts*, not actions, and they get their own board.

Open it with the **Projects & Operations** button in the toolbar, alongside Chat and Actions. A
new campaign's board is empty — *"Nothing on the board yet"* — until events and your advisor
start writing to it; **🧭 Ask your advisor to populate this** gets it to file the efforts you
already have under way.

This is also where research and technology live. There is no tech tree; there is a research
programme with milestones that either progresses or stalls.

![The Projects and Operations board](/wiki/img/projects-board.jpg)
*A board on a campaign that has been running a while. Note the counts — **Mine (4)**,
**Foreign (2)** — the tag chips, the priority control on each card, and that an **ongoing** effort
carries no target date and so can never run late.*

## Projects and operations

Two kinds:

- **Projects** — construction, research, industrial and political programmes. Building
  something, generally.
- **Operations** — military and covert undertakings. Doing something to someone, generally.

Each carries a status:

| Status | |
|---|---|
| `proposed` | Suggested, not yet under way |
| `active` | Running |
| `stalled` | Running, but not moving |
| `paused` | Deliberately halted |
| `complete` | Finished successfully |
| `failed` | Finished unsuccessfully |
| `cancelled` | Abandoned |

The first four are **open** and appear on the default board. The last three are closed and live
behind a separate view.

## Secrecy

| | |
|---|---|
| `public` | Everyone can see it |
| 🔒 `restricted` | Known, but not openly |
| 🕵 `covert` | Hidden |

A covert operation you can see on your own board is not visible to the country it targets —
unless their intelligence service finds it.

## Milestones

A project carries up to **8 milestones**, each dated and either pending, done or missed. The
next pending one is what the board shows you as the thing to watch.

Milestones can **repeat** — weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual or biennial. Marking a repeating
milestone done advances it by one interval from *its own* date, so an annual exercise on 1 June
stays on 1 June rather than drifting. A missed occurrence is deliberately **not** rolled
forward: it stays pending and is flagged as missed, because a drill you skipped is a fact about
your country, not a scheduling inconvenience.

A project marked **ongoing** is a standing effort with no planned end. It has no target date and
can never be overdue.

## What you actually control

Two things, and this is deliberate:

**Priority.** `high`, `normal` or `low`. High means the advisor briefs it first and the
simulation is told to keep it moving. Low means it is allowed to drift.

**Abandoning it.** Which routes through cancellation — the project stays on the board under
**Closed**, with the progress it actually reached.

You do **not** author a project's content. Projects are written *by* the world — by events, by
your intelligence service, and by the advisor — in response to what your country is doing. You
steer them; you do not type them into existence.

After each time skip the board is brought into step with what happened — progress, stalls and new
long-term efforts — reading every event of the turn, including ones taken off the timeline as
filler. With **Save AI requests** on, this shares the one after-skip request; it can be turned
off in Settings → AI. If that update fails, the turn is held rather than lost — see
[troubleshooting](/wiki/troubleshooting/#a-held-projects-board). The time skip itself is shown
the board, so an effort you push is narrated as what it actually is.

<p class="beta-note"><b>On beta a project's activity lists only the events that moved it</b>,
rather than every event that mentioned it in passing.</p>

Closing keeps the record. Completing marks pending milestones done and forces progress to 100%;
failing or cancelling marks them missed and preserves the real progress reached. Only an explicit
delete erases a project entirely.

## Completion has consequences

A project can carry changes that release **only on successful completion** — never on
cancellation, never on failure. This is how a five-year programme to build up your intelligence
service actually raises your rating: not gradually, but when it finishes.

It is also why abandoning a project at 90% gets you nothing except the record that you tried.

## Foreign projects, and whether to believe them

The board shows projects belonging to *other* countries too, when your intelligence tells you
about them. Those carry a **verification** state:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Learned openly; the ordinary case |
| **Doubtful** | The agent it came from is compromised |
| **Confirmed** | Corroborated by a clean source |
| **Fabricated** | Established as false |

The loop this creates is the best thing on the board. A [turned agent](/wiki/espionage/) feeds
you planted material. A foreign project opens on your board from it. Later, your
counter-intelligence realises that source was compromised, and the entry is stamped
**Doubtful** — the engine can raise the doubt but it cannot settle it.

The only way to resolve it is to get a **fresh** agent into that country and look again. Until
you do, you are planning against something that may not exist.

## Limits

| | |
|---|---|
| Projects | **120** |
| Milestones per project | **8** |
| Linked events per project | **12** |

The board warns you when you are within ten of the project limit. Past it, **finished work is
evicted first**, oldest by last update — your active programmes are never dropped to make room.

## Filtering

The board filters by owner (yours or foreign), free text, and tag chips, with several sort
orders and a separate **Closed** view. On a long campaign with a busy intelligence service you
will need them.

## Next

- [Espionage](/wiki/espionage/) — where the foreign entries and the doubt come from.
- [Giving orders](/wiki/orders/) — how efforts get started.
- [Relations, treaties and war](/wiki/war/) — the ledgers the board sits beside.
