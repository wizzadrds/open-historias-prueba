The Community Hub is where scenarios are shared. It is the **Community** tab of the main menu,
and it is where every scenario except Modern Day comes from — including the official presets.

You will also see it called the **Scenario Hub**; they are the same thing.

*The hub's shelves. Install counts and likes are real, and a ✓ Official badge marks a verified official post.*

## Browsing

The tab is laid out in shelves:

- **📌 Pinned** — the official and featured scenarios. Only hub collaborators can pin something,
  so this shelf is curated rather than gamed.
- **Most installed** — by real install counts.
- **Most liked** — by reactions on the post.
- **Most recent** — newest first.

A scenario with a **✓ Official** badge was posted by a hub maintainer — verified by GitHub, not by
what the title says. Anything without one is community work, which is most of the hub and where
the more inventive scenarios tend to be. Posts that are not valid scenarios are hidden.

Click any scenario for its detail view: description, cover image, what it contains, and
**▶ Import & Play**.

## The official presets

| Scenario | Start |
|---|---|
| World War II | 1939 |
| Medieval | 1200 AD |
| Rome | 117 AD |
| Mongol World | 1300 AD |
| New World | 1650 |
| Bronze Age | 1200 BC |

That list is not exhaustive — Modern Day and a Fantasy World preset carry the official badge on
the hub as well, and the pinned shelf changes as new work is featured. Treat the hub itself as
the authority rather than this table.

All one click to import.

## Importing

**Import & Play** downloads the bundle, installs it into your library, and starts a game. From
then on it behaves exactly like a built-in scenario — it is yours, it works offline, and you can
edit or clone it.

A bundle carries the map, cities, colours, flags and any custom basemap the author used —
including a map uploaded as a tile archive rather than drawn in the editor — so what you get is
what they built. A game you start from an imported scenario remembers where it came from, so
exporting that game later does not carry the map inside it: the receiver can fetch it from the
hub.

## Updates

If an author ships a newer version of a scenario you imported, an **⬆ Update** button appears on
its card in your Scenarios tab.

Updating replaces the scenario in place. **Games already running on the old version keep
working** — a game is a copy taken at the moment you started it, so it is not disturbed.

## Publishing your own

Build a scenario in [the map editor](/wiki/editor/), then publish it from its card. The game
exports the bundle locally and opens the hub's post form with the details filled in; you attach
the bundle and post it.

Some things worth doing before you publish:

- **Write the description properly.** It is what people read on the card.
- **Set a cover image.** Scenarios without one get skipped.
- **Fill in the *World Before Round One* briefing.** It is what stops a campaign on your map
  feeling like the world began at turn one.
- **Set the deployable troop types.** No air force in 1200 AD.
- **Consider the Simulation Rules field.** House rules injected into the world's instructions are
  what make an alternate-history scenario actually behave like its premise.

## Basemaps and flags

The hub carries more than scenarios. **Basemaps** are posted separately and appear in the
editor's Community tab, and **flag packs** can be shared and installed the same way. A scenario
bundle can also carry its own basemap.

## How it works underneath

The hub is a GitHub repository — `Open-Historia/Open-historia-scenarios` — where every issue is
a posted scenario. Likes are GitHub reactions; the pinned shelf is a label only collaborators can
apply.

Listings are cached for five minutes, so a brand-new post may take a moment to appear.

Install counts come from a small counter service, deduplicated per person. It records that a
scenario was imported and nothing else — no game data, and nothing identifying.

Because it is GitHub, you can browse the hub in a web browser, and a scenario you cannot reach
in-game can always be downloaded from the repository directly and imported with the library's
**Import** button.
