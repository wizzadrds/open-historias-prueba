The common failures, and what actually fixes them.

Before anything else: **☰ → Settings → Advanced → Diagnostics** holds the game's log — what you
did, and every error and API failure along the way. **🔎 View log** reads it in place. It usually
explains the problem immediately, and it is what to attach to a bug report.

## The map is blank

**In the browser.** The web build streams its map from community-run content nodes. If none is
reachable you get no map. Reload; if it persists, the node network is having a bad day — try
again later, or use the desktop app, which stores the map locally.

**On desktop.** The map data failed to download on first launch. It is about 200 MB fetched
separately from the installer. Restart the app and let the startup screen finish. From a source
checkout, run `node scripts/fetch-map-assets.mjs`.

**A full-screen WebGL warning.** The map cannot render without WebGL. Update your graphics
drivers; in a browser, check that hardware acceleration is enabled. On a virtual machine or over
remote desktop, WebGL is often unavailable.

## The AI is greyed out or does nothing

Work through these in order:

1. **Is a provider configured?** ☰ → Settings → AI. No key, no world. Look at the **Models**
   list: an entry reading **Unusable** says what is wrong with it, such as `key rejected (401)` or
   `model not found (404)`. Fix it and the mark clears.
2. **Is the key right?** Paste it fresh; keys often pick up whitespace.
3. **Is the model name right?** A model you type must exist on that provider. Left blank, OpenAI
   uses `gpt-5.6-luna` and OpenAI Compatible picks one from the server's list.
4. **Is the endpoint right?** Compatible providers need the base URL, usually ending `/v1`.
   An address that points at the service's website rather than its API gets a web page back
   instead of an answer. The error quotes a line of that page and tells you to check the address,
   which should start with `https://` and usually end in `/v1`.
5. **Are you in the browser build with a provider that needs a relay?** The hosted website
   cannot relay. Gemini and Anthropic work there; OpenAI and most compatible endpoints do not.
   Use the desktop app. See [connecting an AI provider](/wiki/ai-setup/).

## Turns fail, or always fall back to canned events

This is almost always the model failing to produce valid structured output.

- **Your model is too small.** Below about 7B this is common. See
  [AI providers and models](/wiki/ai-providers/).
- **Its context window is too small.** A turn's prompt is large, and a model limited to a few
  thousand tokens cannot take it. A turn needs **32k tokens or more**, and 128k is comfortable.
  The error says the context window was exceeded and how big the request was. Once a model has
  said how big its window is, the game remembers and does not send it a request that cannot fit:
  the call goes to the next model in the list instead, or, if none can take it, is not sent at
  all and says so.
- **Toggle Strict tool schema** (on the connection, in Settings → AI). Some gateways and local servers handle the strict
  form of structured output badly, and flipping this fixes it outright.
- **Try a different model on the same provider.** Some are far better at this than others.
- **Check the diagnostics log** — it will show you what came back.

## Turns hang forever

**Turn on Limit AI generation** (Settings → AI). It abandons a generation that has gone silent and
falls back rather than waiting indefinitely. It watches for silence rather than total time, so it
will not cut off a slow-but-working model.

Then: **Cancel** in the time panel always works and leaves the world untouched.

If it is a local model, it may genuinely be that slow — check whether it is producing tokens at
all. If it is a cloud model, you may be rate limited.

## When a request fails

Model calls fail: a provider is overloaded, a rate limit bites, a response comes back empty.
The game's answer is that **a failure should cost you the thing that failed, and nothing else**.

### The advisor

A failed answer appears as an error in the thread with a **Retry** button. Press it and the same
question is asked again — you do not retype anything, and if it succeeds the thread reads as
though the error never happened.

![An advisor request that failed, with Retry](/wiki/img/retry-advisor.jpg)
*Your question is kept above the error, so Retry re-asks it as written. The button beside it is
**💾 Save logging file** while the diagnostics log is on, and **Copy for a bug report** when it is
off — see [reporting a bug](#reporting-a-bug).*

Retry is offered on the **newest** error only. Most advisor failures are the transport or an
overloaded provider rather than anything about your question, and the transport has already
waited and tried once by the time you see this.

### Diplomatic messages

The same, in the chat. A message that fails to get a reply shows an error bubble with **Retry**
on it. Pressing it re-sends that message; the conversation carries on as if it had worked first
time.

![A diplomatic message that failed, with Retry](/wiki/img/retry-diplomacy.jpg)
*The message you sent stays in the thread. Retry asks Berlin again; nothing needs retyping.*

### A held time skip

This is the one that saves real time. When a long skip is generated in segments and one segment
does not come back, the turn is **held**, not failed:

- Nothing has been written. Your campaign is still on its old date.
- The segments that already succeeded are still in hand.
- **Retry re-runs only the segment that failed** — the minutes spent on the earlier ones are not
  spent again.

The panel goes amber rather than red for exactly that reason: a held turn is recoverable. If a
retry fails it says so plainly and counts the attempts, rather than re-showing the same message
and looking like a dead button. Discard the turn and run it as a shorter skip if it keeps
failing. See [time and turns](/wiki/time/).

### A held Projects board

The turn's events can succeed while the **Projects & Operations** update fails. When that happens
the turn is held the same way: *"Your events are ready, but the Projects & Operations board did
not update, so nothing has been saved yet."* (With **Save AI requests** on, the board is one of
the checks that share the after-skip request.)

**Retry the board** and it finishes the turn, keeping the events that already came back. You do
not re-run the whole simulation to fix a board that was the only thing to fail. Discard it and
the turn runs again from the start.

The turn is released before the retry runs, so a turn can never be applied twice, and it is only
held again if the **board** fails a second time.

### If retrying does not help

Undo the turn from the time panel and try a shorter skip, or a different model.

## Every model has used its allowance

*"Every model in your Fallback list has used its allowance for now. The first back is …, at …"*

No entry in Settings → AI → **Models** can answer: each one is **Spent** or **Unusable**, and
at least one is Spent. The time skip did not start, rather than fall back to canned events.
Either wait until the time shown, or add a backup — a paid key or a local model — and play on
now. If you know a model is back sooner, for example because you just topped up billing, press
**Reset** on its entry.

If instead it says *"No model in your Fallback list can answer"*, nothing is coming back on its
own: an entry is **Unusable**, and the message names it and what is wrong. See
[backup models](/wiki/ai-setup/#backup-models).

## The writing suddenly changed

A notice near the top of the screen says when the game moves to a backup model, and why:
*"… has used today's allowance. Now using …"*. A different model writes differently. Settings →
AI shows which entries are Spent and when each comes back.

## Rate limits

Symptoms: turns fail intermittently, or stall on long jumps while short ones work.

Free tiers have per-minute limits that a long jump can exceed, and a daily allowance that a busy
session can. Options: leave **Save AI requests** on (a skip then costs one to three requests),
use the smaller/faster model in the family (limits are usually more generous), add a
[backup model](/wiki/ai-setup/#backup-models), or move to a paid tier.

A rate limit is not the same as a Spent allowance. By default the game hands the call straight to
the next model in your list, and the next call starts at the top again, since a per-minute limit
is usually over by then. Settings → AI → **When a model is rate limited** → **Wait, then try it
again** waits it out on the same model instead: slower, but it keeps your backups' allowance.

**A busy provider is named as busy.** When a provider refuses because it is overloaded — even
partway through an answer — the game says so rather than treating it as a model that answered
with nothing: *"… is overloaded right now. Nothing is wrong with your game, your model or your
message."* It retries once after five seconds; still busy, that model sits out for ten minutes
and the next one in your list takes over.

## CORS errors with a local model

The error will name a blocked cross-origin request.

- **Ollama** — usually works as-is at `http://localhost:11434/v1`.
- **LM Studio** — make sure the local server is actually started, and check whether it has a
  CORS setting to enable.
- **llama.cpp** — `llama-server` may need to be started with CORS permitted.
- **Use the desktop app**, which relays around this automatically. The hosted website cannot.
- **Check `http` vs `https`** and that the port matches.

## Everything is slow

- Turn off **3D Terrain**. It is by far the most expensive thing in the game.
- Turn off the **3D Globe**.
- Turn on **Reduce motion**.
- Turn on **Hide country labels**.
- Zoom out, or switch to a lighter basemap such as Light Gray Canvas.
- On the desktop app, close and reopen it — a long session accumulates map tiles.

## I lost my games

**In the browser** — clearing site data clears your campaigns. There is no server-side copy
unless you signed in, which syncs them. Grant persistent storage permission when asked.

**On desktop** — saves are files in the app's data directory and are still there. If the library
looks empty, the app may be pointed at a different data directory.

**After installing the beta** — the beta build keeps a **separate library** by design. Your
stable campaigns are untouched; they are just not visible from the beta app. Open the stable app
and they are there.

## A country is behaving incoherently

The world drifted. Fix it rather than restarting:

- **Undo the turn** in the time panel and try different orders.
- **Roll Back Turn** in cheats, to go back further.
- **GM Console** in cheats — describe what should be true, preview exactly what it will change,
  and apply it.
- **Simulation Reminders** in cheats — a standing fact every AI is told until you withdraw it.
- **Country Editor** or the **Event Editor**, to correct a specific fact.

See [cheats and the GM console](/wiki/cheats/). Using these is normal; an AI-driven world
occasionally produces nonsense, and repairing it is part of running a long campaign.

## Windows says the installer is unsafe

The installer is not code-signed yet. Choose **More info → Run anyway** in SmartScreen.

## macOS will not open the app

Also not code-signed. Right-click the app and choose **Open**, then confirm. Once only.

## Reporting a bug

**Turn on detailed logging first** — ☰ → Settings → Advanced → Diagnostics — then reproduce the
problem. It records
far more than the normal log, including the full text of the exchange that went wrong, and it is
usually the difference between a report someone can act on and one that cannot be diagnosed. See
[the settings reference](/wiki/settings/#detailed-logging).

Then **💾 Save log file** (or **💾 Save log file + game**, which attaches the campaign it happened
in) and open an issue at
[GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia/issues). The
[Discord](https://discord.gg/QaqAK7fQAg) is faster for "is this just me?".

**The failure itself hands you the file, too.** A turn that fell back
to canned events, a failed advisor reply and a board update the advisor could not apply each have
a <b>💾 Save logging file</b> button. It saves the whole diagnostics log as a file, with that
failure's details — for a turn, the model's raw response in full — in a <i>Reported problem</i>
block at the top. Attach the file. With the diagnostics log turned off there is no log to save, so
the button copies the one failure instead, under its old label (<b>Copy debugging message</b> or
<b>Copy for a bug report</b>). The Android app cannot save files, so there it copies the whole log
and says so.

<p class="beta-note"><b>On beta the Android app saves files too</b>, through Android's share
sheet, so the log and the game can be attached there as well.</p>

Include your platform, your build (stable or beta), your provider and model, and what you were
doing.
