// --- boot -------------------------------------------------------------------

// Find a port nothing else holds, starting at `start`. requestSingleInstanceLock
// already stops US from double-binding, but it cannot help when something else
// owns the port — Docker publishing 3000, another dev server, Grafana. Then
// server.js's app.listen() fails and the failure reaches the main process as an
// uncaught exception: the raw "A JavaScript error occurred in the main process"
// dialog, with no hint that a port is the problem. server.js DOES have a friendly
// EADDRINUSE handler, but it attaches to the returned server on the line AFTER
// listen(), which is too late if listen() throws synchronously rather than
// emitting. Probing first sidesteps the whole question: by the time server.js
// runs, the port it is about to take is known free.
// Every address the server might end up bound to. A port counts as free only if
// it is free on ALL of them, because a bind that succeeds on one says nothing
// about another.
//
// This used to probe the wildcard alone, reasoning that a loopback-only probe
// would miss a 0.0.0.0 publisher. True, but the reverse is what actually reaches
// players, and it is worse: on Windows a wildcard bind SUCCEEDS beside a listener
// on a specific interface (the same SO_REUSEADDR behaviour server/network.test.js
// skips its rebind-rollback assertion for on win32 and darwin). Docker Desktop
// publishes on 127.0.0.1, so it holds 127.0.0.1:3000 while 0.0.0.0:3000 still
// binds cleanly — the probe called 3000 free, server.js bound loopback, and the
// app died on EADDRINUSE with an empty window. Reported from a laptop running
// Docker, 2026-09-04.
