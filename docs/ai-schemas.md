# AI Return Schemas & Validation

Every AI gameplay task in Open Historia hands the model a JSON Schema (as a provider "tool") and gets back a JSON object it must trust before mutating the world. This page documents the schemas the model must return (`src/Game/AI/gameplaySchemas.js`), the hand-rolled two-layer validator that gates every response, and the strict-vs-salvage retry discipline in `runJsonTask` (`src/Game/AI/gameplay.js`) that decides whether a bad answer earns a corrective retry or gets repaired in place. If you are adding a field the model should emit, read the [`additionalProperties: false` trap](#the-additionalpropertiesfalse-trap) first — it is the single most common way a new feature silently does nothing.

Related pages: [World state](world-state.md) (what these payloads mutate), [AI providers](ai-overview.md) (how the schema becomes a tool call in `main.jsx`), [Gameplay orchestration](ai-overview.md) (the task callers), [Gameplay prompts](ai-prompts.md) (the templates rendered alongside each schema).

## 1. The big picture: two files, two validation layers

| Concern | File | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| Schema definitions + generic validator | `src/Game/AI/gameplaySchemas.js` | `GAMEPLAY_SCHEMAS`, `GAMEPLAY_TOOLS`, `validateGameplayPayload` |
| Task orchestration + world-aware validator | `src/Game/AI/gameplay.js` | `runJsonTask`, `validateGeneratedWorldChanges`, timeline/pregame validators, JSON recovery |
| Provider wire format | `src/Game/AI/main.jsx` | `callAI` — turns a `tool` into Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic tool calls, extracts `toolInput` |

A response passes through **two independent validation layers** before it is accepted (`gameplay.js:461-477`):

1. **Layer 1 — schema + generic invariants** (`validateGameplayPayload`, always runs). Structural: types, required keys, `additionalProperties`, ranges, plus per-task rules like the gdpBreakdown sum and distinct-choice checks. Pure function of the payload; knows nothing about the current game.
2. **Layer 2 — the `validatePayload` callback** (optional, world-aware). Only some callers supply it (`jumpForward`, `autoJumpForward`, `gameMaster`, `pregameHistory`, `idleDiplomacy`). It gets `{ attempt, finalAttempt }` and can consult live world state — e.g. `validateGeneratedWorldChanges` resolves region names against the real map. This is where strict-vs-salvage lives.

Both layers return a string error (`""` means valid). A non-empty error on attempt 1 becomes the corrective feedback the model sees on its one retry.

---

## 2. Task registry: schema, tool, and task key

Each task is identified by a **task key**. `GAMEPLAY_SCHEMAS` maps the key to its schema; `GAMEPLAY_TOOLS` maps it to a `{ name, description, schema }` tool object built by `makeTool` (`gameplaySchemas.js:637`). `getGameplayTool(taskKey)` (`:733`) is what `runJsonTask` calls to get the provider tool; `validateGameplayPayload(taskKey, value)` (`:852`) is what validates the result.

| Task key | Schema export | Tool name (provider function name) | Called from |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actions` | `ACTIONS_SCHEMA` | `submit_actions` | `generateActions` |
| `jumpForward` | `JUMP_FORWARD_SCHEMA` | `submit_jump_result` | `simulateTimelineJump` |
| `autoJumpForward` | `AUTO_JUMP_FORWARD_SCHEMA` (**= `JUMP_FORWARD_SCHEMA`**, `:429`) | `submit_jump_result` | `simulateAutoJump` |
| `descriptionToAction` | `DESCRIPTION_TO_ACTION_SCHEMA` | `submit_description_to_action` | freeform-intent → command |
| `nextSpeaker` | `NEXT_SPEAKER_SCHEMA` | `submit_next_speaker` | diplomatic chat turn order |
| `eventConsolidator` | `EVENT_CONSOLIDATOR_SCHEMA` | `submit_event_consolidation` | `consolidateHistoryBatch` |
| `interactiveCreation` | `INTERACTIVE_CREATION_SCHEMA` (**= `interactiveSchema`**, `:517`) | `submit_interactive_creation` | opening an interactive event's scene |
| `interactiveExecutor` | `INTERACTIVE_EXECUTOR_SCHEMA` | `submit_interactive_execution` | advance an interactive event |
| `interactiveSummary` | `INTERACTIVE_SUMMARY_SCHEMA` | `submit_interactive_summary` | finished interactive event → event |
| `gameMaster` | `GAME_MASTER_SCHEMA` | `submit_game_master` | `applyGameMasterCommand` |
| `countryStatSheet` | `COUNTRY_STAT_SHEET_SCHEMA` | `submit_country_stat_sheet` | national stat sheet |
| `timelineCurator` | `TIMELINE_CURATOR_SCHEMA` | `submit_timeline_curator` | one judgment per fresh event; native gates in `nativeTimelineCurator.js` decide what a judgment may remove |
| `unitDirector` | `UNIT_DIRECTOR_SCHEMA` | `submit_unit_director` | unit operations for the turn's military events (sanitized by `nativeUnitDirector.js`) |
| `idleDiplomacy` | `IDLE_DIPLOMACY_SCHEMA` | `submit_idle_diplomacy` | idle inbox drip |
| `pregameHistory` | `PREGAME_HISTORY_SCHEMA` | `submit_pregame_history` | pre-game backstory |

`getGameplayTool` returns `null` for an unknown key; `validateGameplayPayload` returns `{ valid: false, error: "Unknown gameplay task key: …" }` (`:854`).

### How a schema becomes a tool call

`callAI` (`main.jsx`) receives the `tool` and adapts it per provider (`main.jsx:494-627`):

- **Gemini** — `tools: [{ functionDeclarations: [{ name, description, parameters: toGeminiSchema(schema) }] }]`, forced via `allowedFunctionNames`. `toGeminiSchema` **strips `additionalProperties` and `$schema`** recursively (`main.jsx:211-219`) — Gemini rejects those keys.
- **OpenAI-compatible** — `tools: [{ type: "function", function: { name, description, parameters: schema } }]` in `tool` mode; falls back to `response_format: { type: "json_schema", … }` and then `{ type: "json_object" }` on 400/422 (`main.jsx:605-650`). The schema is sent **verbatim, including `additionalProperties: false`**.
- **Anthropic** — native `tool_use`; `extractAnthropicToolInput` reads `block.input`.

The parsed arguments come back as `response.toolInput`. `runJsonTask` prefers that; if the model answered in prose (local models with no tool support), it falls back to `extractJsonPayload(rawText)` (`gameplay.js:460`).

---

## 3. Shared building blocks

Small factory helpers keep the schemas DRY (`gameplaySchemas.js:1-15`, `:562`):

| Helper | Produces | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `textSchema(desc)` | `{ type: "string", description }` | optional free text |
| `nonEmptyTextSchema(desc)` | `textSchema` + `minLength: 1` | enforced by the validator's `minLength` check |
| `stringArraySchema(desc)` | `{ type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }` | e.g. `aliases`, `tags`, `invitees` |
| `percentageSchema(desc)` | `{ type: "integer", minimum: 0, maximum: 100 }` | all stat-sheet indices |

Every object schema sets `additionalProperties: false`. Understand what that means before adding fields — see [§7](#7-the-additionalpropertiesfalse-trap).

---

## 4. Payload schemas — field tables

Only fields listed in a schema's `properties` are legal; anything else is rejected. "Req?" is membership in the schema's `required` array. Sub-schemas are broken out so you can trace nesting.

### 4.1 `impactsSchema` — structured world-state effects (`:282`)

The heart of the map-mutating pipeline. Attached to events (`eventSchema.impacts`) and to `GAME_MASTER_SCHEMA.impacts`. "Include only effect arrays that are relevant." Consumed by `validateGeneratedWorldChanges` and then applied to [world state](world-state.md).

| Field | Type | Meaning | Req? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actionIds` | `string[]` | Player action ids this event resolves | no |
| `createdChats` | `createdChatSchema[]` | Diplomatic chats the event opens toward the player | no |
| `polityChanges` | `polityChangeSchema[]` | Polity metadata changes (name/color/reputation/tags…) | no |
| `regionTransfers` | `regionTransferSchema[]` | **Map ownership changes.** Required by prompt whenever narration says territory changed hands — one entry per region | no |
| `regionClaims` | `regionClaimSchema[]` | **Territory claimed but not held.** Marks a region disputed (striped) *without* moving the border — an irredentist declaration, a proclaimed union, a contested frontier. `drop: true` withdraws a claim | no |
| `unitOps` | `unitOpSchema[]` | Military unit mutations | no |
| `markerOps` | `markerOpSchema[]` | Structures built/destroyed on the map | no |
| `reports` | `reportOpSchema[]` | **Documents only some governments hold** — `create` (title, body, `visibleTo` of full polity names, optional `reportId`/`from`/`dateline`) or `share` (`reportId`, `visibleTo`, optional `from` — the holder who passed it on). `from` decides the thread and the speaker when a document reaches the player through diplomacy. Never carries impacts: what moved the map stays in the public event. See [reports](ai-overview.md#reports-what-only-some-governments-know) | no |

### 4.2 `regionTransferSchema` (`:90`)

| Field | Type | Meaning | Req? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `regionId` | string | Exact region id **or plain name** (engine resolves names → ids) | **yes** |
| `regionName` | string | Human-readable name, when known | no |
| `fromCode` | string | Previous owner polity code — lets the resolver locate the region | no |
| `toCode` | string | New owner polity code | **yes** |
| `note` | string | Brief reason | no |
| `basis` | enum | **Why the land moves** — `treaty` · `annexation` · `unification` · `independence` · `occupation` move the map; `claim` · `threat` · `raid` do not. The vocabulary, its synonyms and the screen live in `runtime/territoryBasis.js`. | no |

`basis` also rides on the **`control`** variant of `regionControlOpSchema` (not on `contest`, which is already the middle state, nor on `clear_contest`, which moves nothing toward anyone). It is **optional on purpose**: an older payload, the Game Master console and a lenient local backend all answer without it, and an entry with no basis is applied exactly as before. A value outside the enum fails schema validation, so the in‑turn retry can name a real one. What the engine does with a `claim` — it becomes a `regionClaims` entry — is in [AI overview](ai-overview.md#strict--salvage-validation-discipline).

> **The schema has a size budget.** `projectOpSchema.test.js` holds the serialized jump tool schema under 32,000 characters, because it rides on every request. That is why the definition of `basis` is stated once (on `regionTransfers`) and the control operation only points at it, and why the long explanation is a call‑time directive (`TERRITORY_BASIS_DIRECTIVE`) rather than a field description. At 31,372 characters there are about 600 to spare: a new impact family should follow the board's example and take its own call rather than join this contract.

### 4.3 `polityChangeSchema` (`:107`)

A creation/rename/recolor/metadata change. Only `code` is required; send other fields **only when they change**.

| Field | Type | Meaning | Req? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `code` | string | Exact polity code | **yes** |
| `name` | string | New name, only when it changes | no |
| `color` | string | New six-digit hex color, only when it changes | no |
| `aliases` | `string[]` | Alternative names | no |
| `reputation` | number | International reputation 0–100, only when it changes (0 = pariah, 100 = universally trusted) | no |
| `tags` | `string[]` | Complete new trait list (ideology/alignment/posture) — send the whole list, not a delta | no |
| `note` | string | Brief reason | no |

> `reputation` is the canonical example of the [`additionalProperties: false` trap](#7-the-additionalpropertiesfalse-trap): the prompt asked for it and `gameState` clamped/wrote it, but it was **absent from `properties`** — so a strict `json_schema` provider could never emit it and reputation silently never moved. Declaring it (`:119`) is what connected the feature.

### 4.4 `unitOpSchema` — `anyOf` on `op` (`:178`)

Not a single object: an `anyOf` of four shapes discriminated by `op`. Each branch is `additionalProperties: false`, so fields from one op leaking into another fail validation.

| `op` | Required fields | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `spawn` | `op`, `unit` | full `unitSchema` object |
| `move` | `op`, `unitId` | `at` **or** `toLng`+`toLat`; + optional `regionId`, `posture`, `note` |
| `strength` | `op`, `unitId`, `strength` | `strength` integer 0–100 |
| `remove` | `op`, `unitId` | + optional `note` |

`unitSchema` fields: `id`, `name`* (nonempty), `type`* (enum: `infantry|armor|air|naval|artillery|garrison`), `ownerCode`* (nonempty), `strength`* (integer 1–100, a percentage of established strength), `composition`* (nonempty), `at` (where, in words), `lng` (−180..180), `lat` (−90..90), `regionId`, `status` (enum `idle|moving|engaged|pending`), `posture`, `note`. (\* = required.)

**`at` — where, in words** (`atSchema`, shared by a spawn, a move, a build and an update). A phrase naming places the map knows — "near Kharkiv", "eastern Ukraine", "off Sevastopol", "Donetsk Oblast facing Russia" — resolved to a point at validation by `src/Game/AI/placement.js` (see [placing things by name](ai-overview.md#placing-things-by-name-and-keeping-them-apart)). It is why `lng`/`lat` are no longer required on a spawn or a build: a model that guesses a longitude puts an army in the sea, and a model that names a place does not. When both are given, `at` wins; an operation left with neither is dropped by the normalizer exactly as one that never had coordinates. The phrase is described once, in the schema's one-line field description, and explained once, in the `[Placing Things]` directive — the jump's schema has a size budget (`projectOpSchema.test.js`), and five copies of a grammar would spend it.

### 4.5 `markerOpSchema` — `anyOf` on `op` (`:256`)

| `op` | Required | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | `op`, `marker` | full `markerSchema` |
| `build` (flat) | `op`, `name` | the structure's fields beside `op` — the shape models write most, accepted rather than failing the turn |
| `update` | `op` | `markerId` (preferred) or `name`; `kind`, `ownerCode`, `status`, `note`; `at` or `lng`+`lat` only when it genuinely relocates |
| `remove` | `op`, `name` | + optional `markerId`, `note` |

`markerSchema` fields: `id`, `name`* (nonempty), `kind`* (nonempty free-form lowercase noun — city/base/silo/embassy…), `ownerCode`, `status`, `at` (where, in words — see §4.4), `lng` (−180..180), `lat` (−90..90), `note`, `foundedAt`. `normalizeMarkerOperationShape` carries `at` (also read from `place`/`where`/`location`) through to validation and omits `lng`/`lat` it was not given, so a build placed by name is not refused for the coordinates it does not have yet.

> **Note:** `validateGeneratedWorldChanges` (Layer 2) also accepts `op: "found"` as an alias of `build` and `op: "destroy"` as an alias of `remove` (`gameplay.js:1095`, `:1105`), and for a build reads coordinates from `operation.marker ?? operation`. The **schema itself only declares `build`/`remove`** — the aliases pass Layer 1 only because `unitOp`/`markerOp` schemas validate loosely (see the caveat in §6).

### 4.5-bis `projectOpSchema` — ONE object, discriminated by `op` (`:805`)

Unlike `unitOpSchema` and `markerOpSchema`, this is a single object with an `op` enum and all-optional fields, not an `anyOf`.

| `op` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `create` | open a new effort (give it a `summary` too) |
| `update` | progress moved, or the status changed; `newName` renames |
| `milestone` | a checkpoint reached or missed (`projectMilestoneSchema`, `:607`) |
| `complete` / `cancel` / `fail` | it ended; all three keep it on the board under Closed |
| `remove` | erase an entry that should never have been opened — NOT how a project ends |

Required: `op` and `name`. `eventIndex` says which of the events this op follows from.

> **Why it is not an `anyOf`.** It used to be, with six branches — and three of them (nested `create`, flat `create`, `update`) each restated `projectSchema`'s twenty properties in full. Serialized, that was **41,538 characters of a 63,161-character jump schema**: two thirds of the entire output contract for one impact branch, more than three times every other branch combined, sent on every jump and once per segment.
>
> It was also duplication rather than information. `normalizeProjectOp` (`runtime/gameState.js`) already accepts a create written flat *or* nested (`operation.project ?? operation`), already resolves every op alias, and already merges a create naming an existing project into an update of only the fields it carried. The schema was spending 13 KB describing tolerance the reducer had all along.
>
> Collapsing it was also a **reliability** win, not only a size one: a six-branch `anyOf` is one of the worst constructs for Gemini's OpenAPI subset (see `geminiSchema.js`) and for small local models, which routinely pick the wrong branch or blend two. `onComplete` was thinned the same way — it re-embedded `polityChangeSchema`, `regionTransferSchema` and `regionClaimSchema` in full, all three of which appear elsewhere in the very same payload.
>
> The nested `create` spelling survives as a permissive `project: { type: "object" }` key. The model is no longer told to nest, but `additionalProperties: false` means one that does anyway would fail validation and cost the whole turn — the exact failure the flat variant was added to prevent. ~150 characters instead of 13,000.
>
> `src/Game/AI/projectOpSchema.test.js` is the safety net: every op shape the six-variant schema accepted must still validate.

### 4.5-ter `PROJECTS_SCHEMA` — the board's own task (`:2082`)

`projectOps` no longer appears on a jump at all. `jumpImpactsSchema` is `impactsSchema` minus that branch, and the board is moved by a separate `projects` call (`submit_project_ops`) that runs once per jump, after the segments merge and before anything is written.

```
{ "projectOps": [ { "op": "update", "id": "...", "name": "...", "eventIndex": 0, "progress": 58, ... } ] }
```

`{"projectOps": []}` is a valid and expected answer — the prompt says so explicitly, because a schema that rejected it would push the model into inventing progress, which is the one thing the board must never contain.

The **game master keeps the full `impactsSchema`**, board included: it is a single call with no second pass to hand the work to.

Jump schema size across the two changes, measured when they landed: **63,161 → 31,678 → 21,609 characters.** It grew again with what beta added to the jump (31,720 once `at` joined), and the **description audit** brought it to **24,915**: every field description says what the field *is* in a line, because the levers are explained at length in the actions reference and the call-time directives the jump is always given — a paragraph in a field description was the same paragraph a third time. The guard in `projectOpSchema.test.js` is now **28,000**, raised on purpose when `impacts.reports` landed (26,363 chars; ~1,450 for the family). It is a prompt-size guard, not a provider limit: an impact family that saves a *request* may raise it — reports inside the jump cost ~1,450 characters instead of a whole request a turn, which is the trade the budget asks for.

### 4.5-ter `CHAT_ACTIONS_SCHEMA` — one turn of a conversation

`{ actions: chatActionSchema[], memorySummary? }`, the answer to one request that acts for every AI participant in a thread (`submit_chat_actions`; see [group diplomacy](ai-overview.md#group-diplomacy-one-request-for-the-whole-table)).

`chatActionSchema` is ONE object with a `type` enum — send_message, add_reaction, rename_chat, add_member, remove_member, create_poll, add_poll_option, poll_vote — and all-optional fields, like `projectOpSchema` and for a harder reason: **Gemini refuses a function declaration whose `anyOf` has more than six branches** (bisected live: six passed, seven did not) and this vocabulary has eight. Nothing is lost, because `normalizeChatAction` (`chatActions.js`) enforces what each type needs before anything is applied, and a malformed action costs only itself.

`pollRef`/`optionRef` are the batch's own labels for a poll it invents, so it can be created and voted in the same answer; the engine mints the real ids. A label is accepted where a ref is expected — the model writes them that way.

### 4.6 `createdChatSchema`

The initiating polity always speaks first — a blank untitled chat tells the player nothing.

| Field | Type | Meaning | Req? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | string (nonempty) | Purpose (e.g. "French mediation offer") | **yes** |
| `countries` | array (`minItems: 1`) of polity **names** | The other side; never the player | **yes** |
| `openingMessage` | string (nonempty) | Initiator's first message, in leader's voice; never the player | **yes** |
| `speaker` | string (nonempty) | Name of the polity sending the opener; never the player | **yes** |
| `linkedEventId` | string | Optional cause link | no |

`countries` are plain names — what the actions reference has always shown (`{"countries":["..."]}`) and what `resolveInvitees` (gameplay.js) has always read. The schema used to demand `{code, name}` objects, so a model that followed the prose failed the schema; `normalizeChatShape` (gameplaySchemas.js) still folds an object to its name for a campaign whose frozen prompt shows the old shape, on the jump, the idle pulse and the GM transport alike. At validation the resolved `{code, name}` list replaces the names on the kept event, so everything that reads a *stored* chat's participants sees the shape it always did. The message list, `source` and `status` the schema once carried were never taught and are the engine's to fill (`buildGeneratedChat`).

### 4.7 Jump payload — `JUMP_FORWARD_SCHEMA` (`:399`)

Also used for `autoJumpForward`. This is the largest task.

| Field | Type | Meaning | Req? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `events` | `eventSchema[]` | Dated events during the period | **yes** |
| `stopDate` | string | Date the simulation stops | **yes** |
| `summary` | string | Concise period summary | **yes** |
| `clearActions` | boolean | Were queued player actions resolved | **yes** |
| `diplomaticOutreach` | `createdChatSchema[]` | Polities reaching out on their own initiative, not tied to any event | no |

`eventSchema` (`:322`): `id`, `date`* , `title`* , `description`* , `importance`, `kind`, `notable` (bool), `playerRelated` (bool), `impacts` (`impactsSchema`).

There is **no scene** in the answer: a scene begins only when the player takes up an interactive event, an event of the skip that the engine offers for it now and then at no cost (`runtime/interactiveOffer.js`; `interactiveCreation`). The schema used to carry a `catalyst` on every skip, into a save no panel showed it from; an answer that still carries one has it dropped by `normalizeGameplayPayload` before validation, never refused.

#### Ledger transports (`warUpdates`, `relationUpdates`, `agreementUpdates`)

Three optional strings, one record per line, fields separated by `~`. They deliberately stay text: the nested object form is what Gemini function calling and strict tool modes choke on, and the formats are taught in the live prompt (`buildWarLedgerDirective` / `buildDiplomaticLedgerDirective` in gameplay.js), so every campaign carries them whatever guidance it edited (ai-prompts.md §2).

| Transport | Line | Ops |
|---|---|---|
| `warUpdates` | `warId~op~actorsCSV~opponentsCSV~eventNumbersCSV~note` | start, join-a, join-b, leave, ceasefire, resume, end |
| `relationUpdates` | `A~B~score~status~eventNumbersCSV~summary` | absolute score; a blank status is derived from it |
| `agreementUpdates` | `agreementId~op~type~partiesCSV~eventNumbersCSV~title~terms` | start, update, suspend, resume, end, expire |

`eventNumbersCSV` (1-based) is a hint first: the engine rebinds war records from `event.warId` and the transition's wording (`normalizeWorldWarEventLinks`, in `nativeWarLedger.js`) whenever an event carries the record's warId, and the diplomatic director binds relation and agreement records to the one event that matches. When no event carries the warId the model's own numbers are kept rather than blanked, so the validator reports the real defect (the event is missing its `warId`) instead of asking for a number the model already gave. Validation runs per segment against the world as the earlier segments left it (`validateSegmentLedgers`): strict while a retry remains, repaired on the final attempt (`repairWarLedgerPayload`): a record's own event numbers are stamped onto their events as the warId they declare, a record that still cannot bind is dropped with the war bindings of its events (events of wars that already exist keep theirs), and the segment is kept — the events stand as narrative, and only the canonical war change is lost, logged to the diagnostics log. Accepted records are bound to the segment's event ids, concatenated by `mergeSegmentPayloads`, remapped to the canonical round-scoped ids minted in `applySimulationResult` (`src/runtime/eventIdentity.js`), and applied by `applyWarUpdates` / `applyDiplomaticUpdates`. `eventSchema` carries `warId` and `combatants[]` for the combat rule (docs/world-state.md §2b-bis).

`PREGAME_HISTORY_SCHEMA` takes the same facts for round zero as one flat `canonicalUpdates` array (`canonicalUpdateSchema`: `kind` = relation | war:<op> | agreement:start, plus id / polities / opponents / score / category / title / detail), which `expandCanonicalUpdateEnvelope` turns into the three transports before `validatePregameCanonicalBootstrap` runs.

### 4.8 `interactiveSchema` (`:346`) and executor/summary

`INTERACTIVE_CREATION_SCHEMA` is `interactiveSchema` directly.

| Schema | Fields (required*) |
|---|---|
| `interactiveSchema` | `title`*, `premise`*, `opening`*, `choices`* (array, `minItems: 2`, `maxItems: 5`, nonempty items) |
| `INTERACTIVE_EXECUTOR_SCHEMA` (`:519`) | `summary`*, `resolved`* (bool), `nextChoices`* (array `maxItems: 5`, nonempty items) |
| `INTERACTIVE_SUMMARY_SCHEMA` (`:539`) | `title`*, `description`*, `importance`* |

### 4.9 Small single-purpose schemas

| Schema | Fields (required*) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ACTIONS_SCHEMA` (`:369`) | `topics`* (array `minItems:1`); each topic: `title`*, `description`*, `actions`* (array `minItems:1` of `actionSchema`) | Strategic topics + concrete actions |
| `DESCRIPTION_TO_ACTION_SCHEMA` (`:483`) | `title`*, `text`*, `kind`*, `invitees`, `chatStarter` | Freeform intent → structured command |
| `NEXT_SPEAKER_SCHEMA` (`:497`) | `nextSpeaker`* | Whose turn in a chat |
| `EVENT_CONSOLIDATOR_SCHEMA` (`:507`) | `summary`* | Continuity-safe history summary |
| `GAME_MASTER_SCHEMA` (`:551`) | `summary`*, `impacts`* | GM intervention + world effects |
| `IDLE_DIPLOMACY_SCHEMA` (`:468`) | `chat`* (`null \| createdChatSchema`) | At most one idle note, or `null` for silence |
| `PREGAME_HISTORY_SCHEMA` (`:448`) | `events`* (array `minItems:1`,`maxItems:12` of `pregameEventSchema`), `summary`* | Pre-game backstory |

`actionSchema` (`:17`): `id`, `title`*, `text`*, `kind`, `invitees`, `chatStarter`. `pregameEventSchema` (`:434`): `date`*, `title`*, `description`*, `importance`, `kind` — **deliberately no `impacts`** (a backstory event is a record, not a change to apply, `:431`).

### 4.10 `COUNTRY_STAT_SHEET_SCHEMA` (`:569`)

A complete national statistics sheet. Every top-level object below is required; every nested field is required within its object.

| Group | Fields | Type |
|---|---|---|
| top level | `capital`, `continent`, `government`, `leader` | nonempty string |
| top level | `stability` | percentage (int 0–100) |
| `indices` | `sovereignty`, `foodAutonomy`, `energyAutonomy`, `economicIndependence`, `internalSecurity`, `internationalReputation` | percentage each |
| `economy` | `gdp`, `gdpGrowth`, `gdpPerCapita`, `currency`, `inflation`, `unemployment`, `publicDebt`, `budgetBalance` | nonempty string each |
| `gdpBreakdown` | `agriculture`, `industry`, `services` | percentage each — **must sum to exactly 100** (see §5.3) |

---

## 5. Layer 1 validation — `validateGameplayPayload` (`:852`)

Two stages inside one function: the generic schema walk, then per-task rules.

### 5.1 `validateAgainstSchema` — the hand-rolled schema walker (`:744`)

There is **no Ajv / JSON-Schema library** here; validation is a bespoke recursive walk supporting exactly the keywords the schemas use. If you use a JSON-Schema keyword this walker doesn't implement, it is silently ignored.

| Keyword handled | Behavior | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `anyOf` | Passes if the value matches **any** candidate; else concatenates all sub-errors | `:745` |
| `type` | `integer` = number AND `Number.isInteger`; missing `type` matches anything | `:751` |
| finite check | `number`/`integer` must be `Number.isFinite` (rejects `NaN`/`Infinity`) | `:759` |
| `minimum`/`maximum` | numeric bounds | `:763` |
| `enum` | value must be in the list | `:771` |
| `minLength` | string length (this is how `nonEmptyTextSchema`'s `minLength:1` is enforced) | `:775` |
| `minItems`/`maxItems` | array length | `:780` |
| `items` | recurse into each element | `:787` |
| `required` | each key must be an own-property (via `hasOwnProperty`) | `:796` |
| `additionalProperties: false` | any key not in `properties` → `"… is not allowed."` | `:805` |

`valueType` (`:735`) distinguishes `null`/`array`/`object`/primitive so error messages are precise. `propertyPath` (`:741`) builds JSONPath-ish locations (`$.economy.gdp`, `$.events[3].date`) so retry feedback names the exact offending field.

> **Caveat — nested `anyOf` schemas validate loosely.** `unitOpSchema` and `markerOpSchema` have `anyOf` at the top of the item but **no `type`** on the wrapper. The walker's `anyOf` branch tries each candidate and passes if any matches. Because the candidate objects use `additionalProperties: false`, a mostly-correct op usually matches one branch — but this is a weaker guarantee than a discriminated union. The real teeth for unit/marker ops are in Layer 2 (`validateGeneratedWorldChanges`), which is why alias ops like `found`/`destroy` slip past Layer 1.

### 5.2 Per-task generic rules

After the schema walk passes, `validateGameplayPayload` runs task-specific checks. These exist because the schema can't express cross-field constraints or non-blank-after-trim.

| Task | Extra rule | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `jumpForward` / `autoJumpForward` | `stopDate` non-blank; every event's `date`/`title`/`description` non-blank after trim; **at least one of** events or a non-empty summary | `:866` |
| `pregameHistory` | every event's `date`/`title`/`description` non-blank; `summary` non-blank | `:892` |
| `descriptionToAction`, `nextSpeaker`, `eventConsolidator`, `interactiveCreation`, `interactiveExecutor`, `interactiveSummary`, `gameMaster` | a per-task list of top-level fields must be non-blank after trim (`requiredTextByTask`, `:906`) | `:915` |
| `interactiveCreation` | `choices` distinct (`validateDistinctChoices`) | `:921` |
| `interactiveExecutor` | `nextChoices` **must be empty when `resolved`**; must have **≥2** when unresolved; must be distinct | `:926` |
| `countryStatSheet` | deep no-blank-strings (`findBlankString`); **gdpBreakdown sum = 100** | `:937` |
| `actions` | each topic `title` non-blank; each action `title` AND `text` non-blank | `:946` |

Helpers backing these:

- **`validateDistinctChoices`** (`:828`) — trims + lowercases each choice, flags the first blank, then rejects if the `Set` size differs from the array length (duplicate detection).
- **`findBlankString`** (`:836`) — recurses the entire value (objects and arrays) and returns the JSONPath of the first whitespace-only string. Used by `countryStatSheet` so no field in the sheet ships blank. Note this is stricter than the schema's `nonEmptyTextSchema` (which only checks `minLength`, so `"   "` would pass the walker but fail here).

### 5.3 The `gdpBreakdown` sum-to-100 rule (`:940`)

```
if (breakdown.agriculture + breakdown.industry + breakdown.services !== 100)
  return { valid: false, error: "$.gdpBreakdown percentages must sum to 100." };
```

Each part is already a `percentageSchema` (int 0–100) by Layer 1, but three in-range integers can still sum to 97 or 110. This exact-equality check (`!== 100`, not a tolerance band) guarantees the three-slice pie the stat sheet renders is coherent. A model that emits `40/40/30` fails and, on attempt 1, is told to fix it.

### 5.4 The capture-reluctance guard (Layer 2, `gameplay.js:1011-1032`)

Not in `validateGameplayPayload` — it lives in `validateGeneratedWorldChanges`, which jump/GM tasks pass as their `validatePayload` callback. The recurring field report it fixes: "two turns of invasions and not a single province transferred."

Logic (strict attempt only):

1. Sum `regionTransfers` across all event `impacts` containers.
2. If the total is **0**, scan every event's `title`+`description` against `CAPTURE_LANGUAGE` — a deliberately narrow, word-boundary-anchored regex of *capture verbs* (`captur*`, `seiz*`, `annex*`, `conquer*`, `occupy/ies/ied/ation`, `overran`, `liberat*`, `retak*`, `cede*`, `fell to`, `falls to`; `gameplay.js:994`).
3. If any event narrates a capture but zero regions moved, return a corrective error telling the model to add `regionTransfers` to every capture event **or** strip the capture language.

It is narrow by design: "preoccupied"/"occupational" never match, and defensive battles that move no borders (war verbs, not capture verbs) are a legitimate zero-transfer turn and never trip it. English-only heuristic; non-English games just skip the nudge. Because it is **strict-only**, it can never cost a finished turn on the final attempt.

---

## 6. `validateGeneratedWorldChanges` — the world-aware Layer 2 (`gameplay.js:1002`)

Passed as `validatePayload` by `jumpForward`/`autoJumpForward` (`gameplay.js:1916`) and `gameMaster` (`:1965`). It both **validates and mutates in place** (canonicalizing region ids, dropping dead ops), so a payload is only accepted after it has passed through here clean. Signature: `(candidate, world, { strictTransfers })`. `strict = strictTransfers` and callers set it to `!finalAttempt`.

| Check | Strict behavior (attempt 1) | Salvage behavior (final attempt) | Line |
|---|---|---|---|
| Region transfers unresolvable against the map | Return `buildTransferFeedback` — the losing owner's real region list so the model can resend with exact ids/names | Leave unresolved transfers for normalization to drop | `:1007` |
| Capture narration + zero transfers | Corrective error (see §5.4) | Skipped entirely | `:1020` |
| `createdChats` with no known participants | Reject | Drop the chat, keep the turn | `:1042` |
| `createdChats` opener/title missing | Reject (`validateChatOpener`) | Skipped | `:1046` |
| `unitOps.spawn` missing name/ownerCode | Reject | Drop the op | `:1059` |
| `unitOps.spawn` duplicate id | Reject | `delete unit.id` so normalization mints a fresh one | `:1064` |
| `unitOps` targeting a nonexistent `unitId` | Reject | Drop the op | `:1079` |
| `markerOps.build` missing name / coords | Reject | Drop the op | `:1097` |
| `markerOps.remove` missing name+id | Reject | Drop the op | `:1106` |
| `diplomaticOutreach` with no known participants / bad opener | Reject | Drop the outreach | `:1126` |

`buildTransferFeedback` (`:940`) caps at the first 3 unresolved transfers and lists up to 40 candidate regions each (`"Pomorskie (POL.11_1)"`) — small, targeted vocabulary so the model can fix "Pomerania" into a real id on the retry instead of losing the map change.

## 7. The `additionalProperties: false` trap

**A field that is not declared in a schema's `properties` cannot round-trip — even if the prompt asks for it and the writer code handles it.** Two independent gates enforce this:

1. **The provider.** In OpenAI `json_schema` mode (and strict tool modes), the schema — including `additionalProperties: false` — is sent verbatim and the provider constrains generation to it. The model literally cannot emit an undeclared key. (Gemini is the exception: `toGeminiSchema` strips `additionalProperties`, `main.jsx:216` — but you cannot rely on that, since other providers enforce it.)
2. **The local validator.** Even if a model volunteers an extra key, `validateAgainstSchema` returns `"… is not allowed."` for any property missing from `properties` when `additionalProperties === false` (`gameplaySchemas.js:805`). The payload is rejected.

The lived example is `reputation` on `polityChangeSchema`. The prompt requested it, `gameState` normalized/clamped/wrote it — but the field was missing from `properties`, so `additionalProperties: false` meant a strict provider **could never emit it** and international reputation silently never moved. The fix (`:117-123`) was simply to declare it. The in-code comment is worth reading before you touch any schema.

**Checklist to make a new field emittable:**

1. Add it to the relevant schema's `properties` (with a good `description` — the model reads it).
2. Add it to `required` only if it must always be present (most impact fields are optional).
3. Make sure the writer/normalizer in [world state](world-state.md) actually reads and applies it.
4. If it needs a cross-field or non-blank rule the schema can't express, add it to `validateGameplayPayload` or the task's `validatePayload` callback.

Skipping step 1 is the silent-no-op failure mode.

## 8. `runJsonTask` — the request/validate/retry harness (`gameplay.js:382`)

Every AI gameplay call goes through this one function. It owns prompt assembly, the abort/timeout budget, the two-attempt loop, and the fallback.

### 8.1 Options

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fallback` | Async function returning a deterministic payload when the AI can't produce a valid one. If absent, failure **throws** instead of falling back (`:519`). |
| `signal` | External `AbortSignal` (player pressed Cancel) — propagated into `callAI` and the server relay (`:435`). |
| `timeoutMs` | Default `120000`. `0`/non-finite **disables** the deadline (jumps use `0` unless "Limit AI generation" is on → 300000, `:1888`). |
| `userMessage` | The single user turn seeding `history`. |
| `validatePayload` | Optional Layer-2 callback `(candidate, { attempt, finalAttempt })`. |
| `variables` | Template variables for the rendered system prompt. |

### 8.2 Prompt assembly (before the loop)

1. `loadPromptCatalog` + `renderTemplate` build the system prompt from the current templates plus the campaign's guidance edits (ai-prompts.md §2).
2. Append the **difficulty directive** from `readGameData().difficulty` (`:400`).
3. For `jumpForward`/`autoJumpForward`: nothing is appended; the live records are rendered into the template at `${JUMP_LIVE_STATE}` before it renders (ai-prompts.md §6a).
4. For `actions` and the interactive event tasks: append **[International Reputation]** context.

### 8.3 The two-attempt loop (`:447-502`)

```
for (outputAttempt = 1; outputAttempt <= 2; outputAttempt++):
    response = callAI(systemPrompt, history, { deadline, maxTokens: 8192, signal, tool })
    parsed   = response.toolInput ?? extractJsonPayload(rawText)          // §9
    validation = parsed ? validateGameplayPayload(taskKey, parsed) : {invalid}   // Layer 1
    if (validation.valid && validatePayload):
        taskError = await validatePayload(parsed, { attempt: outputAttempt,
                                                    finalAttempt: outputAttempt === 2 })   // Layer 2
        if (taskError) validation = { valid:false, error: taskError }
    if (validation.valid): return { generation:{source:"ai"}, payload: parsed }
    if (outputAttempt === 1 && !aborted):
        history.push(model turn = rawText)
        history.push(user turn = "Your previous structured answer failed validation: <error> <retryInstruction>")
        continue
```

Key details:

- **`maxTokens: 8192`** is a per-response output ceiling only for capped providers; Gemini ignores it (`:450`). Jumps used to request 16384, which only raised the ceiling and did nothing useful.
- **`retryInstruction` adapts to how the model answered** (`:493`): a model that used a tool is told to "Call `<tool>` again with corrected input"; a prose model (no tool support) is told to "Respond again with ONLY the corrected JSON object". Telling a tool-less local model to call a tool it can't see would waste the one retry.
- Only **one retry** exists (attempt 1 → attempt 2). Spend it wisely — this is why strict validators front-load the most fixable errors.

### 8.4 `finalAttempt` — the linchpin of strict vs salvage

`finalAttempt` is `outputAttempt === 2`, computed **in `runJsonTask` from the real attempt counter** (`:474`), never from counting validator invocations. The comment at `:465-472` explains why this matters: if attempt 1 dies at the schema/parse layer, `validatePayload` never runs, so a self-counting validator would think attempt 2 was its "first" call, emit *strict* feedback meant for the model, and hand that string to the player as a fallback reason (a real field report: fallbacks that read "Resend the same response with…"). Sourcing `finalAttempt` from the loop counter is what keeps strict feedback pointed at the model and salvage pointed at the player.

### 8.5 Strict vs salvage — the contract

Every Layer-2 validator follows the same discipline. `strict = !finalAttempt`:

- **Attempt 1 (strict):** return a **corrective error string** describing exactly what's wrong. This becomes the retry message; the model usually fixes its own answer. Shape problems (wrong event count, stray dates, unresolvable region names, bad ops) are all strict here.
- **Attempt 2 (final = salvage):** **never reject a finished generation to the canned fallback over cosmetics.** Instead repair in place: `clampTimelineDates` pulls stray dates into the window (`gameplay.js:187`, `:1914`), unresolvable transfers/ops are dropped, duplicate unit ids are deleted so normalization re-mints them. A good story with sloppy dates beats canned events every time.

The jump validator (`:1897-1917`) is the canonical example: `const strict = !finalAttempt;` gates the event-count check, then `validateTimelineDates` (strict → return error; salvage → `clampTimelineDates`), then `validateGeneratedWorldChanges(..., { strictTransfers: strict })`. `pregameHistory` (`validatePregameEvents`, `:2013`) and `idleDiplomacy` follow the identical pattern.

### 8.6 Outcomes

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Valid payload (either attempt) | `{ generation: { source: "ai", fallbackReason: "" }, payload }` (`:480`) |
| Player cancelled (`signal.aborted`) | **Throws** the abort reason — never silently falls back (`:513`) |
| No `fallback` provided + failure | Throws `AI task "<key>" failed: <reason>` (`:520`) |
| `fallback` provided + failure/timeout | Warns, returns `{ generation: { source: "fallback", fallbackReason }, payload: await fallback() }` (`:524`) |

Callers read `generation.source`/`fallbackReason` to tell the player whether they got a real AI turn or the deterministic fallback.

## 9. JSON recovery — `extractJsonPayload` (`gameplay.js:284`)

When a model answers in prose instead of a tool call, `runJsonTask` must dig the JSON out. The recovery ladder:

1. **Strip think blocks** — `<think>…</think>` and a leading `…</think>` (reasoning models / Ollama templates prepend these) (`:287`).
2. **`lenientJsonParse`** the whole text (`:230`): try `JSON.parse`; on failure repair the two slips small models make — curly `"smart"` quotes → `"`, and trailing commas before `}`/`]` — then reparse. Repairs run **only after** a strict parse fails, so well-formed output is never touched.
3. **Any fenced block** — `` ```json ``, `` ```JSON ``, `` ```javascript ``, or bare `` ``` `` — parsed leniently (`:297`).
4. **`balancedJsonCandidates`** (`:243`) — a string-aware brace/bracket walker that extracts every balanced top-level `{…}`/`[…]`, sorted objects-first so a stray inline array in the model's commentary can't shadow the real object payload. Each candidate is parsed leniently; first object wins.
5. Returns `null` if nothing parses → Layer 1 reports `"Response did not contain parseable JSON or tool arguments."`

This ladder is what lets local/self-hosted models without tool support still play; hosted providers normally return clean `toolInput` and skip it entirely.

## 10. Where to look when…

| You want to… | Go to |
|---|---|
| Add/change a field the model returns | `gameplaySchemas.js` `properties` + [§7 trap](#7-the-additionalpropertiesfalse-trap) |
| Add a whole new task | Add schema → `GAMEPLAY_SCHEMAS` + tool → `GAMEPLAY_TOOLS`, then a caller using `runJsonTask` |
| Change what makes a payload invalid (generic) | `validateGameplayPayload` (`gameplaySchemas.js:852`) |
| Change map/world-aware validation | `validateGeneratedWorldChanges` (`gameplay.js:1002`) |
| Tune retry feedback wording | The corrective strings returned by the validators (they are shown to the model verbatim) |
| Debug "the AI turn silently became a fallback" | `runJsonTask` `failureReason`, and check whether a strict error leaked (see `finalAttempt`, §8.4) |
| Debug provider tool wiring | `callAI` in `main.jsx` ([AI providers](ai-overview.md)) |
